{"doi": "10.1016_j.foodchem.2007.08.038", "summary": "This study investigates the polyphenolic profiles of 24 common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) samples, representing 17 varieties across 10 US commercial market classes, using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS). The beans were classified into six distinct groups based on their phenolic content, revealing significant variations in flavonoid components while all samples contained similar hydroxycinnamic acids.\n\nKey findings include the identification of various flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids. Black beans predominantly contained 3-O-glucosides of delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin, while pinto beans were rich in kaempferol and its glycosides. Light red kidney beans showed traces of quercetin 3-O-glucoside and its malonates, whereas pink and dark red kidney beans contained diglycosides of quercetin and kaempferol. Small red beans were characterized by kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, while alubia, cranberry, great northern, and navy beans lacked detectable flavonoids.\n\nThe study reports the first tentative identification of quercetin 3-O-pentosylhexoside and flavonoid glucoside malonates in common beans, alongside a detailed detection of hydroxycinnamates. The analytical methods employed, including acid and alkaline hydrolysis, facilitated the isolation of aglycones and the identification of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, which were found to be the main phenolic components across all bean types.\n\nThe research highlights the potential for breeding programs to select for specific flavonoid profiles that may enhance nutritional value and antioxidant properties. The distinct flavonoid profiles observed among the market classes suggest avenues for further exploration in plant breeding and food science, particularly in relation to the bioavailability and health benefits of these compounds. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the phenolic composition of common beans, which are a significant source of dietary nutrients and bioactive compounds."}
{"doi": "10.1016_j.foodchem.2012.11.079", "summary": "The review article by Losso et al. (2021) explores the hypothesis that the combination of a young population and a plant-based diet contributes to the lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions. The authors note that despite high population densities in urban areas, the region has reported significantly lower infection and mortality rates, which they attribute to several factors, including dietary patterns and gut microbiota diversity.\n\nThe plant-based diet prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa includes whole grains (millet, sorghum), legumes (black-eyed peas, dry beans, soybeans), and various vegetables, which are rich in bioactive compounds such as protease inhibitors. These compounds, particularly those found in legumes like dry beans, are suggested to inhibit serine proteases that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The authors emphasize the role of dietary protease inhibitors, such as those from soy products and sweet potatoes, in potentially reducing COVID-19 severity by modulating immune responses and gut health.\n\nThe review highlights the significance of gut microbiota, which is influenced by diet. The authors reference studies showing that individuals consuming traditional plant-based diets exhibit higher microbial diversity and a predominance of beneficial bacteria, such as Prevotella, compared to those on Western diets, which are often high in animal proteins and sugars. This microbial diversity is associated with better immune function and lower rates of dysbiosis, a condition linked to increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nThe authors also discuss the demographic aspect, noting that the median age in sub-Saharan Africa is significantly lower than in regions like Europe and North America, where older populations face higher risks of severe COVID-19 due to age-related immune decline and comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes. The prevalence of these risk factors is notably lower in sub-Saharan Africa, further supporting the hypothesis.\n\nWhile the article presents compelling correlations between diet, age, and COVID-19 outcomes, the authors call for further clinical and biostatistical research to substantiate these claims. They suggest that understanding the interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and immune response could inform public health strategies and dietary recommendations to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and similar infectious diseases in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, this review underscores the potential protective effects of a plant-based diet rich in protease inhibitors and the importance of demographic factors in shaping health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings advocate for a multidisciplinary approach that integrates food science, nutrition, and public health to address the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic."}
{"doi": "10.1016_j.foodchem.2019.01.148", "summary": "This study by Giusti et al. (2019) investigates the behavior of phenolic compounds in six legume varieties—black lentils (Lens culinaris Medik.), black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), ruviotto beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), pinto beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), desi chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.), and black chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.)—during domestic cooking and in vitro digestion. A novel HPLC-DAD method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of 14 phenolic compounds, including anthocyanins such as delphinidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside, and other phenolics like gallic acid, catechin, and ferulic acid.\n\nThe results indicate that the cooking process significantly reduces both free and bound phenolic compounds, with the cooking water serving as a notable source of these compounds. The study highlights that soaking and boiling lead to substantial leaching of phenolics, particularly in the soaking water, where compounds like gallic acid and chlorogenic acid were detected at higher concentrations than in the raw legumes. The authors observed that the phenolic content was generally higher in the cotyledons compared to the seed coats, suggesting that cooking facilitates the solubilization and inward diffusion of phenolics from the coat to the cotyledon.\n\nBioaccessibility studies employing a standardized in vitro digestion protocol revealed that only a fraction of the phenolic compounds is bioaccessible, with significant differences noted between the coats and cotyledons of the legumes. For instance, delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside were largely absent in the intestinal phase, likely due to their instability at intestinal pH. Conversely, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid were detected post-digestion, indicating some degree of bioavailability.\n\nThe findings underscore the complex interactions between phenolic compounds and the legume matrix, which may limit their bioavailability due to strong physical interactions with cell wall materials. This study contributes valuable insights into the nutritional implications of legume processing, emphasizing the need for further research on the bioavailability of phenolic compounds and their potential health benefits, particularly in relation to gut microbiota metabolism. The validated HPLC-DAD method provides a robust tool for future studies on phenolic profiles in legumes and other food matrices."}
{"doi": "10.1016_j.foodchem.2022.132900", "summary": "This study investigates the impact of growth region on the cell wall properties and hard-to-cook (HTC) phenotype of canned navy beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), specifically comparing beans grown in Ontario (hard beans, HB) and Manitoba (soft beans, SB). The research reveals significant differences in mechanical properties, water absorption, and cell wall composition between the two bean types, highlighting the influence of agri-climatic conditions on bean quality.\n\nMechanical testing demonstrated that HB required 46.4% more force to disrupt than SB, with HB absorbing 12.5% and 14.7% less water during blanching and canning, respectively. Microscopic analysis showed that canning resulted in swelling of the middle lamella and cell walls, yet cell adhesion was preserved in both bean types. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated a reduced labeling of methyl-esterified homogalacturonan (HG) and increased levels of non-methyl-esterified HG and arabinan in HB, suggesting a structural basis for the observed hardness.\n\nCompositional analysis revealed that HB contained 46.5% more arabinose and 51.8% more galactose than SB, with HB polysaccharides being less water-soluble. ELISA results from the canning medium confirmed that SB exhibited higher solubility of cell wall polymers, indicating a transfer of soluble pectic polysaccharides during processing. The study utilized monoclonal antibodies (JIM5, JIM7, and LM6) to localize pectin epitopes, revealing that HB had stronger binding to un-esterified HG and arabinan, while SB showed greater binding to methyl-esterified HG.\n\nThe findings suggest that the differences in cell wall composition, particularly the solubility and structure of pectic polysaccharides, are critical in determining the HTC phenotype. The study posits that the activity of pectin methylesterases (PMEs) during bean maturation may contribute to the mechanical strength of HB by promoting de-methylation of pectin, leading to stronger cell walls and enhanced cell adhesion.\n\nThis research underscores the importance of understanding how environmental factors influence the textural and nutritional quality of legumes, with implications for breeding programs aimed at improving canning quality and consumer acceptability. The results provide a foundation for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the HTC phenomenon in legumes, potentially guiding the selection of cultivars with desirable processing characteristics."}
{"doi": "10.1016_j.foodres.2018.12.006", "summary": "This research article investigates the economic viability of legume-cereal rotations, specifically focusing on faba bean (Vicia faba) and wheat, in Morocco's dryland agricultural systems. Utilizing an endogenous switching regression model, the study analyzes data from 1230 farm households over two years, revealing that faba bean-wheat rotations yield significant economic advantages compared to wheat monocropping. The findings indicate that adopting these rotations can lead to an average gross margin increase of US$537 per hectare (48%) over monocropping, alongside enhanced yields and household food security.\n\nThe study highlights several ecological benefits associated with faba bean cultivation, including improved nitrogen fixation, enhanced phosphorus availability, and favorable microbial communities in the rhizosphere. Despite these advantages, the research uncovers a counterintuitive trend: farmers practicing rotations do not reduce nitrogen fertilizer application compared to monocroppers, which undermines the ecological benefits typically expected from legume-cereal rotations. This suggests that while rotations enhance yields, farmers may not be fully leveraging the ecological advantages of reduced fertilizer use.\n\nThe analysis also emphasizes the importance of improved faba bean varieties, which are associated with higher yields and gross margins. The simultaneous adoption of both improved varieties and rotations yields an even greater economic benefit, with an estimated total gross margin increase of US$497 per hectare (44%) over monocropping. However, the adoption rates of improved faba bean varieties remain low, attributed to farmers' preferences for local varieties that meet market demands better, despite the higher yields of improved types.\n\nThe study employs robust analytical methods, including propensity score matching and endogenous switching regression, to address selection bias and evaluate the impacts of adoption on yield, gross margin, and consumption. The results underscore the need for targeted policy interventions to promote the adoption of improved faba bean varieties and rotations, which could enhance food security and economic resilience in Morocco's dryland regions.\n\nIn conclusion, the research provides compelling evidence for the economic and ecological benefits of faba bean-wheat rotations, while also identifying critical barriers to the adoption of improved varieties. The findings suggest that enhancing farmers' awareness of these benefits and developing new varieties that align with market preferences could significantly improve agricultural practices in Morocco's drylands."}

The research addresses the pressing need for increased dry bean yields to meet global food demands, particularly in the context of biotic and abiotic stresses.\n\nThe authors simulated multiple breeding scenarios involving five selection strategies (mass selection, bulk breeding, single seed descent, pedigree method, and modified pedigree method) across three breeding frameworks (conventional breeding, speed breeding, and genomic selection) and four parental population sizes (15, 30, 60, and 100). The traits analyzed included days to flowering (moderate heritability), white mold tolerance (high heritability), and seed yield (low heritability). The simulations utilized the QU-GENE platform and the QuLinePlus module to model genetic gain, fixation of favorable alleles, and genetic variance.\n\nKey findings indicate that the optimal breeding scenario varies by trait. For seed yield, the highest relative genetic gain per cycle (up to 8.69%) was achieved using single seed descent under speed breeding with 100 initial parents. The pedigree method demonstrated efficiency in allele fixation, particularly for white mold tolerance, achieving 100% fixation in just two cycles with 100 parents. Conversely, mass selection was less effective, particularly for traits with low heritability, where it resulted in the slowest allele fixation rates.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) revealed clustering patterns among strategies, indicating that single seed descent and modified pedigree methods often performed similarly, while mass selection clustered towards higher Hamming distances, suggesting poorer performance. The study also highlighted that genomic selection performed comparably to conventional breeding in terms of genetic gain, particularly when parental population sizes were optimized.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of trait heritability and QTL availability in determining the success of breeding strategies. For traits with fewer QTLs, smaller parental populations sufficed, while traits with more complex genetic architectures benefited from larger populations. The study concludes that computer simulations can effectively guide breeding decisions, optimizing genetic gain in dry bean breeding programs by tailoring strategies to specific traits and environmental conditions.\n\nOverall, this work provides a valuable reference for breeders aiming to maximize genetic gain in common bean, emphasizing the need for strategic resource allocation in breeding programs to address the challenges posed by climate change and food security."}

The study reveals that iodine at lower concentrations (0.10 and 0.25 mg/L) promotes plant growth, while higher concentrations (0.50 mg/L) inhibit growth, particularly in green beans. The iodine concentration in the edible parts of lettuce and green beans reached 5.2 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg dry weight, respectively, at 0.25 mg/L KI, with lettuce demonstrating superior iodine uptake and translocation capabilities.\n\nThe experimental setup included pot experiments with controlled conditions, where the uptake and distribution of iodine were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) following microwave-assisted acid digestion. Results indicated that iodine primarily accumulated in the roots of both plants, with only 1% translocated to the fruits of green beans, contrasting with lettuce, where 44-58% of iodine was translocated to the leaves. This low translocation ratio in green beans suggests their unsuitability for iodine biofortification.\n\nAdditionally, the study assessed the impact of iodine on the uptake of essential macro and micronutrients. In lettuce, the presence of iodine significantly enhanced the concentrations of nutrients such as phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) by 20-260%. Conversely, in green beans, nutrient concentration changes were minimal, with only slight increases in Mg and reductions in P and Zn observed.\n\nMorphological and anatomical analyses revealed that iodine treatment affected leaf biomass and structure differently in the two species. Green bean plants exhibited reduced leaf biomass and size under iodine treatment, while lettuce plants showed an increase in leaf number despite a decrease in leaf size at the highest iodine concentration.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of iodine biofortification in leafy vegetables like lettuce, which can significantly contribute to dietary iodine intake, covering approximately 66% of the recommended daily allowance with a 100 g serving. However, the study concludes that green beans are not viable candidates for iodine biofortification due to their low translocation efficiency. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of iodine on soil biota and the broader implications for agricultural practices aimed at addressing iodine deficiency in human diets."}

The primary leaves of two cultivars of common bean (Carioca and Negro Huasteco) and one cowpea cultivar (Epace 10) were subjected to HI (2,000 µmol m–2 s–1) for durations of 10, 20, and 30 minutes. \n\nKey findings indicate that the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of the photosystem II (PSII) was significantly affected by HI exposure, with common bean cultivars exhibiting a gradual decline in Fv/Fm from 10 to 30 minutes, while cowpea showed only slight reductions followed by recovery. Initial fluorescence (F0) remained stable across most genotypes, except for Carioca, which displayed a transient increase. Maximum fluorescence (Fm) decreased in all genotypes, with Epace 10 demonstrating a partial recovery at 30 minutes, suggesting a potential for D1 protein synthesis and PSII repair.\n\nThe study also assessed photochemical (qP) and non-photochemical (qN) quenching mechanisms. Cowpea exhibited enhanced efficiency in energy utilization under HI, characterized by increased qP and decreased qN, indicating a more effective photoprotective response compared to common bean. Lipid peroxidation, measured via malondialdehyde (MDA) content, increased significantly in common bean after 20 minutes of HI, highlighting oxidative stress and membrane damage, whereas Epace 10 showed a return to control MDA levels after 30 minutes, suggesting better membrane integrity under stress.\n\nThe results indicate that cowpea possesses superior tolerance to HI, maintaining photochemical efficiency and membrane integrity, while common bean cultivars are more susceptible to photoinhibition and oxidative damage. The findings underscore the importance of cultivar selection in breeding programs aimed at enhancing stress tolerance in legumes, particularly in environments with high light intensity and temperature. Future research should focus on elucidating the biochemical mechanisms underlying these differential responses, including the roles of the xanthophyll cycle and D1 protein turnover in photoprotection."}

The research identifies key biological parameters of Z. subfasciatus, including egg viability, larval development periods, adult emergence rates, and dry mass consumption, to classify genotypes into four resistance categories: highly resistant, moderately resistant, susceptible, and highly susceptible.\n\nThe experimental design involved a completely randomized setup with 40 replications per genotype. Biological assessments revealed significant differences among genotypes, particularly in the larval to adult development period, with some genotypes exhibiting prolonged life cycles and reduced adult emergence rates. Notably, genotypes such as Raz 49 and Raz 59 were classified as highly resistant, demonstrating significantly lower dry mass consumption by larvae compared to susceptible genotypes like IAC Una and Vermelho Graúdo.\n\nFlavonoid analysis was performed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), identifying isoquercitrin as the only flavonoid present in quantifiable amounts (1.90 to 84.70 mg/g). However, no significant correlation was found between isoquercitrin levels and the biological parameters of Z. subfasciatus, suggesting that other unmeasured compounds may contribute to resistance mechanisms.\n\nStatistical analyses, including univariate and multivariate methods, facilitated the classification of genotypes based on their resistance levels. The susceptibility relative index (SRI) was calculated, revealing that several genotypes did not differ significantly from the susceptible standard, while others exhibited lower SRI values indicative of resistance. The study highlights the importance of parameters such as the duration of development stages and dry mass consumption in determining resistance levels.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of specific bean genotypes for breeding programs aimed at enhancing resistance to Z. subfasciatus. Future research is recommended to further elucidate the biochemical and morphological mechanisms underlying resistance, as well as to explore the agronomic implications of these resistant genotypes for commercial cultivation.

The research aimed to understand how varying seed moisture content (SMC) and storage temperatures influence color darkening, which is critical for market acceptance.\n\nFaba bean seeds were stored at different temperatures (5 to 60 °C) and SMC levels (8% to 14%) for one year. Color changes were quantified using a chroma meter, measuring L*, a*, and b* values, which correspond to lightness, redness, and yellowness, respectively. The study found that higher temperatures and moisture levels accelerated color darkening, with seeds stored at 37 °C or above exhibiting significant changes within weeks. The initial beige color transitioned to darker shades, with the most rapid changes occurring in seeds with higher SMC. Notably, seeds with 8% SMC maintained more stable color compared to those with higher moisture content.\n\nThe research also highlighted the impact of light exposure on color stability. Seeds stored under artificial light darkened significantly faster than those kept in darkness, indicating that light is a critical factor in postharvest quality deterioration.\n\nIn terms of phenolic compounds, the study measured total free phenolics, tannins, and proanthocyanidins in both the seed coat (testa) and cotyledons. A substantial reduction in these compounds was observed with increased storage temperature and duration, correlating with the degree of color darkening. For instance, total free phenolics decreased by 5% at 5 °C and up to 76% at 50 °C after 12 months. Tannins, which were predominant in the testa, showed a negative correlation with color darkening, suggesting their role in maintaining seed quality.\n\nA predictive model was developed to estimate color changes based on temperature, SMC, and storage duration, accounting for 94% of the variance in color change. This model can assist farmers and exporters in determining optimal storage conditions to minimize quality loss.\n\nOverall, the findings emphasize the importance of controlling storage conditions—specifically temperature, moisture content, and light exposure—to preserve the color and phenolic integrity of faba beans, which is essential for maintaining marketability and consumer acceptance. The study provides valuable insights for postharvest management practices in the faba bean industry, highlighting the need for strategies that mitigate color deterioration during storage."}

The study aims to characterize these legumes based on their nitrogen functions, which include nitrogen fixation, soil nitrogen uptake, and the potential for nitrogen leaching, thereby facilitating informed selection for agricultural practices.\n\nThe authors measured five nitrogen pools as proxies for nitrogen functions: nitrogen in seeds (N_seed), nitrogen derived from atmospheric fixation (N_dfa), nitrogen in the following wheat crop (N_wheat), nitrogen uptake from the soil (N_dfsoil), and nitrogen leached after legume harvest (N_leached). They found that legumes like chickpea, common bean, and soybean exhibited high soil nitrogen uptake and low nitrogen leaching, thus minimizing environmental dis-services. Conversely, species such as common vetch, faba bean, and lentil had lower soil nitrogen uptake but contributed significantly to nitrogen availability for subsequent crops due to their high residue nitrogen concentration.\n\nThe study revealed that plant traits, including shoot dry matter, nitrogen harvest index (NHI), and belowground nodule mass fraction (NMFb), explained 76.1% of the variability in nitrogen functions among the legumes. Notably, legumes with high shoot dry matter and NHI tended to have higher nitrogen fixation rates and seed nitrogen concentrations. The authors also identified trade-offs between nitrogen functions; for instance, legumes with high nitrogen uptake from the soil often had lower nitrogen contributions to subsequent crops.\n\nThe research highlights the importance of understanding the functional profiles of different legume species to optimize their use in cropping systems. The multifunctionality index developed in this study assesses the ability of legumes to deliver multiple nitrogen-related ecosystem services, revealing that while some legumes excel in nitrogen fixation, others are better suited for minimizing nitrogen losses. This nuanced understanding can guide farmers in selecting legume species that align with their specific agricultural goals, particularly in the context of sustainable farming practices.\n\nOverall, this study contributes valuable insights into the ecological roles of grain legumes, emphasizing their potential to enhance nitrogen management in agricultural systems while mitigating environmental impacts.

The isolates were characterized using 16S rDNA PCR-RFLP analysis, which revealed a uniform pattern indicative of Rhizobium leguminosarum. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rDNA and recA sequences confirmed that these isolates belong to R. leguminosarum bv. viciae, with some V. faba isolates showing close genetic relationships, suggesting host-specific selection.\n\nThe study utilized network analysis of recA sequences to illustrate a shared evolutionary history among Turkish, European, North and South American, and Jordanian R. leguminosarum bv. viciae isolates. Four haplotypes were identified through nodA and nifH gene sequencing, indicating the presence of distinct symbiotic plasmids. Notably, two haplotypes were common to both V. faba and P. sativum isolates, suggesting that nodulation factors may not be the primary mechanism for the selection of specific R. leguminosarum populations by V. faba.\n\nThe research highlights the significance of Turkey as a potential center for the dissemination of rhizobia associated with these legumes. The findings also suggest that while R. leguminosarum is the dominant symbiont for both faba bean and pea, the genetic diversity of rhizobia is greater in Turkish and European isolates compared to those from Asia. The absence of the nodX gene in Turkish isolates indicates a complex evolutionary history and suggests that the specialized relationship between faba bean and R. leguminosarum may not solely depend on nodulation factors.\n\nOverall, this study contributes to the understanding of rhizobial diversity and its implications for legume cultivation and breeding in Turkey, emphasizing the need for further research to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying host specificity and nodulation efficiency."}

The research focuses on three strains of B. fungorum (UFLA 04-155 and UFLA 04-226) and A. brasilense (BR 11001T), both individually and in co-inoculation with the commercially used Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899T. The study aims to assess the potential of these PGPR strains to enhance bean growth, nodulation, and nutrient uptake, particularly in the presence of mineral nitrogen.\n\nKey findings indicate that while co-inoculation with CIAT 899T did not enhance bean growth, inoculation with B. fungorum UFLA 04-155 alone significantly increased dry weight of nodules and shoots, as well as foliar contents of essential nutrients including phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), and zinc (Zn). Notably, UFLA 04-155 also stimulated nodulation by the indigenous rhizobial community present in the soil. In contrast, UFLA 04-226 showed growth promotion only in the presence of nitrogen fertilizer.\n\nThe experimental design included a greenhouse study with a completely randomized 3×3 factorial scheme, evaluating three nitrogen sources (inoculated with CIAT 899T, control with mineral nitrogen, and a control without inoculation) and three PGPR strains. The results demonstrated that the indigenous rhizobial community was positively influenced by both UFLA 04-155 and A. brasilense BR 11001T, leading to improved nodulation in the common bean.\n\nAnalytical methods included measuring the number of nodules, dry matter of nodules, shoots, and roots, as well as nutrient content in the shoots. The study revealed that the co-inoculation of CIAT 899T with the PGPR strains did not yield significant differences in nodulation compared to CIAT 899T alone, suggesting a lack of synergistic effects among the strains tested. However, the individual application of UFLA 04-155 resulted in a notable increase in shoot dry matter and nutrient content compared to controls without inoculation or nitrogen.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of B. fungorum UFLA 04-155 as a beneficial inoculant for enhancing common bean growth and nutrient uptake, particularly in nutrient-deficient soils. This research contributes to the understanding of PGPR interactions with legumes and highlights the importance of exploring native microbial communities to improve agricultural practices in Brazilian oxisols.

The primary focus is on how these coatings influence water content, color, and sensory quality of the coffee beans.\n\nThe research involved a systematic examination of various factors, including the type of biopolymer, pre-drying time of the suspensions (1 and 3 hours), and the number of immersions (1 and 2) of the beans in the coating suspensions. The coatings were characterized through several analytical methods, including rheological assessments of the suspensions, contact angle measurements, moisture content analysis of the films, and sensory evaluations of the brewed coffee.\n\nKey findings indicate that starch-based coatings exhibited superior moisture resistance compared to chitosan, with the optimal treatment identified as starch with 3 hours of pre-drying and a single immersion. This treatment effectively retained the color and water content of the beans, aligning closely with the control (uncoated beans). Notably, the coatings did not adversely affect the sensory quality of the brewed coffee, as determined by a panel of certified judges using the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) protocol.\n\nRheological analysis revealed that the viscosity of the starch suspension increased significantly with longer pre-drying times, which is critical for minimizing moisture absorption during the coating process. The contact angle measurements indicated that starch films were less hydrophilic than chitosan films, correlating with lower moisture content in starch coatings. Microscopic analyses confirmed uniform coating application, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrating the effective deposition of the biopolymers on the bean surfaces.\n\nThe study concludes that biopolymer coatings, particularly starch-based formulations, can be effectively utilized to enhance the storage stability of green coffee beans without compromising their quality.

The rep gene is crucial for viral replication, and a specific mutation (D262R) was introduced to create a transdominant effect, inhibiting viral replication.\n\nTransgenic plants were generated using a vector containing the mutated rep and bar genes, with 17 initial transformants identified. Among these, the line M1/4 exhibited tolerance to glufosinate ammonium and partial resistance to BGMV, with disease incidence correlating with the number of viruliferous whiteflies. Notably, the transgenic plants showed a significantly higher number of symptomless individuals compared to controls, indicating a degree of resistance.\n\nMolecular analyses confirmed the integration of the rep gene, with Southern blotting revealing two copies integrated at a stable locus across multiple generations. RT-PCR demonstrated the expression of both the rep and bar genes in the transgenic plants, while Western blot analysis detected the mutated REP protein in leaf and stem tissues, but not in seeds. This suggests that the expression of the rep gene may be insufficient for high levels of protein accumulation in seeds, a common limitation in leguminous plants.\n\nThe study also highlights the variable expression of transgenes, which can be influenced by factors such as integration site and copy number. The resistance observed in the M1/4 line appears to be mediated by the expression of the mutated REP protein, which may interfere with the replication of BGMV through a transdominant mechanism. The findings suggest that this genetic engineering approach could provide a viable strategy for enhancing resistance to BGMV in common beans, a crop of significant agricultural importance.\n\nOverall, this research contributes to the understanding of plant-virus interactions and the potential for using transgenic approaches in breeding programs aimed at improving disease resistance in legumes. Future work will involve field trials to assess the practical implications of this resistance in agricultural settings and the transfer of the transgene to elite bean cultivars."}

Notably, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nodC and nifH genes of T29N3L and T44N22P are highly conserved, suggesting co-evolution or lateral gene transfer among these symbiotic bacteria.\n\nA significant aspect of the research is the structural analysis of nodulation factors produced by T44N22P. The study identified three distinct nodulation metabolites, characterized as tetra- and pentameric chitocompounds, which are N-methylated, O-carbamoylated, and N-substituted with either C18:0 or C18:1 acyl chains, all sulfated at the reducing end. These findings contribute to the understanding of the chemical diversity of Nod factors and their role in host specificity and nodulation efficiency.\n\nThe results underscore the ecological significance of rhizobial diversity in agricultural systems and the potential for utilizing these novel isolates in plant breeding programs aimed at enhancing nitrogen fixation and improving crop resilience. The study also raises questions about the evolutionary dynamics of rhizobial populations in relation to their legume hosts, suggesting that further research is needed to explore the genetic and biochemical mechanisms underlying these interactions.

The collection was genotyped using over 2,000 SNPs identified via Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS), revealing a population structure of approximately 69% Andean, 26% Middle American, and 5% admixture. The YBC was evaluated across two major U.S. bean production regions—Michigan (MI) and Nebraska (NE)—over two years, focusing on traits such as days to flower, seed weight, water uptake, and cooking time.\n\nThe phenotypic analysis showed significant variability in cooking times, ranging from 17 to 123 minutes, with NE exhibiting longer and more variable cooking times compared to MI. Notably, 20 genotypes cooked within 20 minutes in MI, while eight genotypes cooked within 31 minutes in NE. Environmental factors, including elevation and humidity, significantly influenced both water uptake and cooking time, with NE's higher elevation contributing to longer cooking times due to the prevalence of hardshell traits.\n\nGenome-wide association analyses identified SNPs associated with cooking time, particularly on chromosomes Pv01, Pv03, Pv04, Pv06, Pv08, and Pv10. A candidate gene, a polygalacturonase located on Pv04, was highlighted for its potential role in influencing cooking time through its effect on pectin degradation during cooking. The study also noted that the cooking time trait exhibited moderate to high heritability, indicating the potential for breeding programs to select for faster cooking varieties.\n\nThe YBC's genetic and phenotypic diversity, particularly the identification of fast-cooking genotypes, provides valuable resources for breeding efforts aimed at improving consumer-focused traits in yellow beans. The findings underscore the importance of considering environmental interactions when assessing cooking time and other traits in breeding programs. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of yellow bean genetics and offers insights for enhancing the nutritional and culinary attributes of this important food legume."}

Specifically, Cyp3a11, Fmo1, Gstm1, and Mif showed increased expression at higher bean doses, while cyclin G1 (Ccng1) and heat shock protein 8 (Hspa8) were down-regulated.\n\nThe results indicated that increased dietary bean intake did not elicit adverse hepatic stress or toxicity responses, even at high concentrations (60% w/w). The expression of Cyp7a1 and Ugt1a6 increased in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting potential mechanisms by which dry beans may confer health benefits, particularly in cholesterol metabolism and detoxification processes. Cyp7a1 is involved in cholesterol catabolism, while Ugt1a6 plays a role in the conjugation and excretion of xenobiotics, including environmental carcinogens.\n\nThis study provides evidence supporting the safety of high dry bean consumption and highlights the potential for beans to positively influence liver function and metabolic pathways associated with chronic disease prevention. The findings suggest that further human intervention studies are warranted to explore the therapeutic properties of dry beans, particularly in relation to their role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.

MassTRIX analysis linked identified metabolites to specific metabolic pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), highlighting alterations in eicosanoid, fatty acid, triacylglycerol (TAG), and steroid metabolism. Notably, the study found that bean consumption downregulated TAG synthesis in the mammary gland, with significant reductions in TAG precursors such as palmitic acid and 2-tetradecenoic acid.\n\nThe analysis also revealed that n-6 fatty acids, particularly g-linolenic acid, were elevated in bean-fed groups, while adrenic acid levels were significantly reduced. In mammary carcinomas, distinct clustering based on bean type was observed, with variations in fatty acyl compounds and prostaglandin levels, particularly PGE3, which was upregulated in bean-fed groups. This suggests that bean consumption may modulate eicosanoid metabolism, potentially influencing tumor growth and progression.\n\nThe findings indicate that different bean genotypes exert varying effects on lipid metabolites, suggesting a genetic basis for the health benefits associated with dry bean consumption. The study underscores the potential of dry beans as functional foods that may contribute to cancer prevention through modulation of lipid metabolism and eicosanoid pathways. Future research is warranted to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms, including the regulation of key genes and enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism.\n\nOverall, this research provides a compelling link between dry bean consumption, lipid metabolism, and cancer risk, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the health benefits of legumes in the context of chronic disease prevention."}

The research highlights the potential of dry beans as a staple food that could mitigate the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) associated with decreased pulse consumption in Western diets.\n\nUsing Sprague-Dawley rats and C57Bl/6 mice, the authors assessed the impact of cooked dry beans incorporated into purified diets on plasma lipid profiles and hepatic proteins involved in lipid metabolism. The results demonstrated that short-term feeding of bean-containing diets significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels in both species, while HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides remained unaffected. Notably, bean-fed obese mice exhibited weight loss and improved plasma lipid profiles within just 12 days, suggesting a rapid response to dietary intervention.\n\nThe study employed various analytical methods, including gene expression profiling to evaluate the induction of cytochrome P-450 cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A), a key enzyme in cholesterol catabolism. A dose-dependent increase in CYP7A expression was observed, correlating with reductions in plasma cholesterol, although the relationship was not statistically significant. This finding indicates that the mechanism of action may involve enhanced cholesterol excretion rather than direct inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, as no significant changes in other lipid regulatory proteins were detected.\n\nThe authors propose that the observed effects of dry beans on cholesterol metabolism and body weight regulation warrant further exploration of the bioactive components responsible for these benefits. They emphasize the potential for screening diverse dry bean cultivars to identify those with superior cardioprotective properties, which could enhance their clinical impact.\n\nThe study concludes that incorporating dry beans into diets could serve as a practical strategy for improving cardiovascular health and managing obesity, addressing both dietary and public health concerns.

The research aims to elucidate the dual role of these beans, which are rich in non-digestible fermentable components and phenolic compounds, in modulating colonic inflammation and gut health.\n\nC57BL/6 mice were fed diets containing 20% navy or black bean flour for two weeks prior to DSS exposure. Both bean diets significantly increased caecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and faecal phenolic compound concentrations compared to a basal diet (BD). Notably, the black bean diet exhibited higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity, attributed to its anthocyanin content, including delphinidin and malvidin.\n\nThe results revealed that while bean diets reduced local colonic inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-9, IFN-γ, and IL-17A) and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, they also exacerbated DSS-induced colonic damage, as indicated by increased histological injury scores and apoptosis markers (cleaved caspase-3 and FasL mRNA expression). Specifically, both bean diets led to a significant increase in apoptosis within the colonic epithelium, suggesting a complex interaction between the beneficial and detrimental effects of beans during colitis.\n\nThe study employed various analytical methods, including quantitative real-time PCR for gene expression analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for serum cytokine levels. The findings indicate that while the bean diets conferred some protective effects against inflammation, they also heightened mucosal damage, potentially due to increased gastrointestinal transit time or interactions with DSS.\n\nIn conclusion, the incorporation of cooked common beans into the diet may offer both beneficial and adverse effects on colonic health during inflammatory conditions.

Notably, the plasma concentration of these metabolites increased significantly within 1 hour post-consumption, indicating rapid absorption and metabolism. The urinary excretion of metabolites was also substantial, with over 50% of certain metabolites excreted within 8 hours, suggesting colonic bacterial metabolism of phenolic compounds.\n\nThe phenolic composition of the beans was influenced by genotype, with the Moleiro variety exhibiting the highest total phenolic content (3.36 mg GAE/g dry weight). Cooking reduced the total phenolic content by approximately 61%, affecting the bioavailability of specific compounds. The study highlights the importance of cooking in altering the phenolic profile and subsequent bioavailability.\n\nInter-individual variability was observed in both plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of metabolites, with variations of up to 73% for specific compounds like kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide. This variability may be attributed to differences in metabolic enzymes, gut microbiota composition, and individual dietary habits.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential health benefits of common beans as a source of bioactive phenolic compounds, while also emphasizing the need for further research into the mechanisms of metabolism and the role of gut microbiota in modulating bioavailability.

The research highlights the economic impact of root rots, estimating losses of approximately 221,000 metric tons annually in sub-Saharan Africa. Historically, root rots in Uganda were primarily caused by Pythium and Fusarium species in high-altitude regions; however, recent observations indicate a shift, with severe root rot occurrences now prevalent in low and medium-altitude agroecologies characterized by warmer, drier conditions.\n\nThe study surveyed seven agroecological zones over three growing seasons (2013A, 2013B, and 2014A), encompassing a total of 1,117 fields. The primary pathogens identified were Sclerotium rolfsii (southern blight), Fusarium spp., Pythium spp., and Rhizoctonia solani. Southern blight emerged as the most prevalent root rot, particularly in lowland areas, while Fusarium and Pythium root rots were more common in cooler, high-humidity environments. The research utilized field observations and symptom identification to assess disease prevalence and incidence, revealing that over half of the surveyed fields were affected by at least one root rot pathogen, with many fields exhibiting multiple infections.\n\nStatistical analyses demonstrated significant seasonal and agroecological variations in root rot prevalence and incidence. For instance, the Teso Farming Systems Zone exhibited the highest prevalence of Pythium root rot, while the South Western Highlands showed significant incidences of both Pythium and Fusarium root rots. The study also mapped disease hotspots, providing critical data for future germplasm evaluation and breeding programs aimed at developing resistant varieties.\n\nThe findings underscore the influence of environmental conditions on root rot dynamics, suggesting that climate change may exacerbate root rot incidences due to increased rainfall and temperature fluctuations.

The research aimed to evaluate the impact of various soil fertility management strategies on bush bean productivity, particularly under conditions of terminal drought, which is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe experimental design employed a split-plot arrangement, with the bean genotypes as main plots and combinations of soil fertility management options (no input, manure, fertilizer, and their combination) and cropping systems (sole crop vs. intercrop) as subplots. The trials revealed that both manure and fertilizer applications significantly enhanced the resilience of the drought-tolerant bean genotypes, with SER45 yielding a 44.4% increase in yield with manure application alone and up to 78.3% when combined with fertilizer in sole cropping.\n\nDespite higher yields in sole cropping, the intercrop treatments with manure and fertilizer demonstrated superior land equivalence ratios (LER) of 1.54 for SER45 and 1.32 for SER83, indicating greater land productivity compared to monocropping. The results suggest that integrating organic and inorganic fertilizers can enhance the climate adaptability of bush bean genotypes and improve overall farm productivity, which is crucial for smallholder farmers in Malawi.\n\nThe study also highlighted the genotype-specific responses to management options, particularly in the Lilongwe agro-ecological zone, where significant interactions between genotype and treatment were observed. In contrast, the Rift Valley zone did not show such interactions, indicating a more uniform response across treatments.\n\nYield data indicated that the combined application of chicken manure and inorganic fertilizers significantly improved bush bean yields, with SER45 showing a notable response to manure alone.

The findings reveal significant variability in how individuals classify certain foods, influenced by cultural norms and familiarity. For instance, rice was classified as a vegetable by approximately 20% of respondents, with notable differences between language groups—Spanish speakers were more likely to categorize rice as a vegetable compared to English speakers. Similarly, black beans were often classified as \"something else,\" particularly among Hispanic respondents.\n\nTomatoes elicited mixed responses, with many considering them both fruits and vegetables, reflecting the complexity of classification. The studies highlighted that while there was consensus on certain foods like corn and bell peppers being vegetables, ambiguity arose with items like ketchup, grape jelly, and tofu, which were frequently categorized as \"something else.\" The authors emphasize that these perceptions are shaped by cultural customs and the context in which foods are consumed, such as in mixtures or processed forms.\n\nThe results underscore the necessity for clear definitions in dietary guidelines and assessments. The authors recommend that dietary assessments include specific questions to clarify food classifications, particularly for items like rice and dried beans, which can be confusing for respondents. They also suggest that nutrition education campaigns should provide explicit guidance on what constitutes fruits and vegetables to enhance public understanding and potentially increase consumption.\n\nOverall, this research highlights the complexities of food classification and the implications for dietary assessment and public health messaging. The findings call for a nuanced approach to defining fruits and vegetables in dietary guidelines, taking into account cultural differences and consumer perceptions to improve nutrition education and health outcomes."}

The authors argue that traditional centralized breeding models, which prioritize uniformity and broad adaptability, often overlook the cultural and culinary significance of regionally adapted varieties. This disconnect can hinder the development of resilient local food systems that reflect community values and preferences.\n\nThe paper outlines four models of crop end-use selection: Centralized, Consumer-based, Farmer-based, and Participatory. Centralized breeding focuses on high-yield, location-neutral varieties, exemplified by wheat and barley breeding aimed at meeting industrial standards. This model often sacrifices genetic diversity and local adaptation, which can be detrimental to regional food cultures.\n\nIn contrast, Consumer-based selection emphasizes heirloom varieties, which are culturally significant but may yield less than modern cultivars. The authors highlight the dilemma of promoting heirlooms that, while unique and flavorful, may not be agronomically competitive. Farmer-based selection allows for the maintenance of local landraces and folk varieties, fostering a deeper connection between farmers and their crops, although it often lacks formal support.\n\nThe Participatory model advocates for collaboration among farmers, breeders, and chefs to develop varieties that meet local culinary needs while improving agronomic traits. This approach has shown promise in various regions, including ongoing projects in Western Washington aimed at selecting high-yield, flavorful hull-less barley and improving heirloom dry beans.\n\nThe authors emphasize the importance of participatory breeding in enhancing local food systems by integrating cultural and culinary attributes into the breeding process. They call for a reassessment of plant breeding priorities to include local adaptation and community engagement, which could lead to the development of varieties that not only perform well agronomically but also resonate with local food cultures.\n\nThe review concludes that a culturally based approach to plant breeding, supported by decentralized public breeding programs and open access to germplasm, is essential for fostering sustainable local food systems. This shift could enhance food sovereignty and contribute to the resilience of agricultural practices in the face of economic and environmental challenges. The authors advocate for increased collaboration among stakeholders to ensure that plant breeding aligns with the values and needs of local communities."}

A total of 450 quails were allocated into three dietary treatments: a control diet (C) and two experimental diets (H1 and H2) incorporating 10% and 15% black soldier fly meal, respectively, replacing portions of soya bean meal and oil. The study aimed to evaluate growth performance, nutrient digestibility, microbiological composition of excreta, feed choice, carcass traits, and meat quality.\n\nResults indicated that dietary treatments did not significantly affect growth performance metrics such as final slaughter weight, body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, or mortality rates. Apparent digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, starch, and energy was comparable across all groups, except for ether extract digestibility, which was lower in the H1 group (P = 0.0001). The microbial composition of excreta showed no significant differences among treatments, suggesting that the inclusion of black soldier fly meal did not adversely affect gut health.\n\nIn terms of meat quality, the inclusion of black soldier fly meal resulted in a lower ultimate pH (pHu) in breast meat compared to the control (5.68 and 5.67 vs. 5.76, respectively; P < 0.0001), which is indicative of improved water retention and potentially better meat quality. However, the H2 group exhibited higher cooking loss and tougher meat (measured by Warner-Bratzler shear force) compared to H1. Notably, the breast meat from the H1 group was the heaviest and most tender.\n\nThe study concludes that black soldier fly larvae meal can effectively replace conventional soya bean meal and oil in quail diets without compromising performance or meat quality. This finding supports the viability of insect meal as a sustainable protein source in poultry nutrition, aligning with global efforts to find alternative feed sources amid rising demands for animal protein.

The research aimed to address the limited herbicide options available for weed management in dry beans, which are particularly sensitive to weed competition.\n\nField trials assessed the impact of both 1× and 2× established label rates of the herbicides on various growth parameters, including visible injury symptoms, plant density, shoot biomass, height, seed moisture content, and yield. Azuki beans exhibited the highest sensitivity, with a 12% reduction in growth observed at two weeks after emergence (WAE) when treated with Group 15 herbicides, while kidney, small red, and white beans showed negligible growth reductions (≤2%). Flufenacet at the 2× rate was particularly injurious, leading to a 27% reduction in azuki bean yield.\n\nVisible injury symptoms included leaf deformation, chlorosis, and necrosis, with azuki beans displaying significant leaf deformation (4% at 2 WAE) compared to other classes, which showed no deformation. The study also noted that flufenacet caused a notable stand reduction in azuki beans (up to 18% at the 2× rate), while the other market classes remained largely unaffected. In terms of shoot biomass, azuki beans experienced a 36% reduction, contrasting with only minor reductions in the other classes.\n\nThe research concluded that kidney, small red, and white beans possess a sufficient margin of safety to tolerate flufenacet, acetochlor, and S-metolachlor PPI applications, supporting their potential registration for use in these crops.

Notably, the phytase activity increased by 21.8% after n-hexane treatment, indicating that the extraction process does not inactivate the enzyme, thus allowing the resultant soybean meal to serve as a natural feed additive.\n\nThe study characterized the phytase's kinetic properties, revealing a Km value of approximately 103 μM, comparable to that of the phytase expressed in E. coli. The enzyme's activity was minimally affected by various metal ions, with notable inhibition observed from Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺. The transgenic lines produced phytase levels ranging from 0.29 to 350 U/g seed, with the highest activity found in line Phs-39, which maintained agronomic traits similar to non-transgenic counterparts, albeit with a slight reduction in 100-grain weight.\n\nThis research highlights the potential of mAppA transgenic soybean as a sustainable alternative to exogenous phytase supplementation in livestock feed, addressing both phosphorus bioavailability and environmental concerns associated with phytate excretion.

The application of Si improved relative water content, leaf water potential, and membrane resistance, which in turn positively influenced photosynthetic pigment content and gas exchange rates. Notably, Si mitigated the adverse effects of water deficit, leading to enhanced photosynthesis and reduced dry mass losses.\n\nThe study also revealed that Si application increased K accumulation in plants, regardless of K fertilization status, suggesting a synergistic effect between Si and K that enhances nutrient uptake and physiological resilience. The research provides novel insights into the role of Si in non-Si-accumulating species like common beans, demonstrating its potential to improve irrigation efficiency and crop resilience in water-limited environments.\n\nStatistical analyses confirmed significant interactions between Si doses and water regimes, with quadratic polynomial fits indicating optimal Si doses for maximizing physiological benefits. The results underscore the importance of Si in enhancing water use efficiency and supporting sustainable agricultural practices, particularly in regions facing water scarcity.\n\nIn conclusion, this study establishes Si fertigation as a viable strategy for improving the physiological performance of common beans under varying water conditions, with implications for enhancing crop resilience in the face of climate change. Future research should further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms and broader applications of Si in legume cultivation."}

Salinity is a significant abiotic stress affecting crop productivity, and common bean, a staple food crop, is particularly susceptible. The research aims to identify genomic regions associated with salt tolerance at the seedling stage, which is critical for developing resilient varieties.\n\nThe authors established optimal experimental conditions for assessing salt stress, identifying 75 mM NaCl as the threshold for inducing significant stress without excessive damage. Phenotypic assessments revealed that salt stress markedly reduced shoot and root dry weights (SDW and RDW), with significant genotype-dependent variations observed. The GWAS identified seven significant SNP markers associated with SDW under salt stress, with candidate genes showing homology to known salt tolerance genes in Arabidopsis.\n\nKey candidate genes linked to the identified SNPs include:\n1. **Pv5-593.01G186800**: An ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, implicated in ion transport and stress response.\n2. **Pv5-593.01G236100**: A RAS-related protein (RABA2B), involved in vesicular trafficking and stress response.\n3. **Pv5-593.05G028500**: An F-box protein (FBXO7), which may play a role in regulating stress responses through protein degradation pathways.\n4. **Pv5-593.09G089900**: A protein phosphatase 1G, known to be involved in signaling pathways that mediate abiotic stress tolerance.\n\nThe GWAS results suggest that the genetic architecture of salt tolerance in common bean is complex, involving multiple genes and pathways. The study highlights the importance of utilizing diverse genetic resources to enhance breeding programs aimed at improving salt tolerance. The findings provide a foundational understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying salt stress responses in common bean, paving the way for future research and breeding strategies to develop resilient cultivars capable of thriving in saline environments.\n\nOverall, this research contributes significantly to the field of plant genetics and breeding, addressing the urgent need for crops that can withstand increasing salinity due to climate change and poor agricultural practices.

The authors highlight that traditional machine learning methods often yield low classification performance due to the imbalanced nature of the datasets, where the minority class is significantly underrepresented.\n\nThe proposed BLSMOTE technique enhances the dataset by generating synthetic samples from the boundary of the minority class, thereby reducing noise and improving model robustness. K-means clustering is employed to categorize the data into distinct groups based on shared features, which aids in refining the classification process. The study demonstrates that the combination of BLSMOTE, K-means, and SVM outperforms traditional methods, achieving a training set accuracy of 98.86% for the dry bean dataset and 99.57% for the obesity levels dataset.\n\nKey performance indicators, including precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC), were significantly improved across all classifiers when using the proposed method. For instance, the BLSMOTE + K-means + SVM achieved an AUC of 0.9831 for the dry bean dataset, indicating superior classification capability. The study also provides decision rules generated by the BLSMOTE + K-means + DT for both datasets, which can be instrumental for practical applications in agricultural and health-related fields.\n\nThe dry bean dataset, sourced from the UCI repository, consists of 13,611 samples with 16 explanatory variables, including morphological features such as Area, Perimeter, and various Shape Factors.

The research demonstrates that the covalent binding of EGCG to BBPI-G results in significant structural changes, as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which indicates protein unfolding and increased emulsifying properties. The emulsions formed from the BBPI-G–EGCG complex exhibited reduced mean particle size and increased interfacial protein adsorption (AP), leading to a thicker oil-water interface and enhanced stability against various stressors including storage, oxidation, thermal treatment, freeze-thaw cycles, and resolubility of freeze-dried powders.\n\nKey findings include:\n1. **Polyphenol Binding Rate**: The binding rate of EGCG to BBPI-G reached a maximum of 96.96% at a concentration of 150 mmol g⁻¹ protein, indicating effective conjugation. This suggests that glycosylation enhances the reactivity of BBPI with EGCG due to increased hydroxyl group availability.\n\n2. **Structural Analysis**: Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the addition of EGCG caused a significant red-shift and fluorescence quenching, indicating exposure of hydrophobic residues and structural changes in the protein. FTIR analysis showed a decrease in α-helix and β-sheet content, with an increase in random coil and β-turn structures, confirming the disruption of the protein's secondary structure upon glycosylation and polyphenol binding.\n\n3. **Emulsifying Properties**: The emulsifying activity index (EAI) and emulsifying stability index (ESI) were significantly higher for the BBPI-G–EGCG complex compared to native BBPI and BBPI-G, highlighting the improved emulsifying capacity due to the covalent interaction with EGCG.\n\n4. **Stability Measurements**: The BBPI-G–EGCG emulsions demonstrated superior stability during storage, with minimal changes in mean particle size over 30 days. Oxidation stability tests indicated that these emulsions had the lowest peroxide value (POV) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, suggesting enhanced resistance to lipid oxidation.\n\n5. **Thermal and Freeze-Thaw Stability**: The BBPI-G–EGCG emulsions maintained their mean particle size during thermal treatments and freeze-thaw cycles, indicating robust thermal stability attributed to the thick interfacial layer formed by the protein-polyphenol complex.\n\nIn conclusion, the study provides insights into the potential of glycosylated black bean proteins as natural emulsifiers in food applications, demonstrating that covalent modification with polyphenols like EGCG can significantly enhance the functional properties and stability of protein-based emulsions.

The research was conducted in the Middle Volga region, where alfalfa is a predominant legume forage, and Fodder galega has emerged as a competitive alternative due to its superior biological and fodder characteristics.\n\nThe study highlights the inherent challenges of using legumes for silage, primarily their low sugar content, which hampers effective fermentation. To address this, \"Silostan,\" a biological product containing lactic acid bacteria, was employed to enhance the preservation process. The results demonstrated that the application of Silostan significantly improved the nutritional profile of both alfalfa and Fodder galega haylage. Specifically, the dry matter content increased by 5.2% for alfalfa and 4.5% for Fodder galega, while digestible protein levels rose by 27.1% and 15.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the energy feed units (EFU) increased by 12.8% and 17.5%.\n\nThe digestibility of nutrients was also enhanced, with increases in dry matter digestibility of 3.85% for alfalfa and 4.38% for Fodder galega when treated with Silostan. This improvement translated into higher milk yields, with cows fed Fodder galega haylage yielding 6132 kg over 305 days of lactation, a 16.5% increase compared to the control group. Additionally, the mass fractions of milk fat and protein increased by 0.05% and 0.07%, respectively, indicating improved milk quality.\n\nTechnological properties of the milk were positively affected, as evidenced by reduced coagulation times and improved rennet characteristics, which are critical for cheese production. The consumption of milk per kilogram of ripened cheese decreased by 4.9% to 11.2%, reflecting enhanced cheese-making efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the study establishes that the use of Silostan in haylage production not only improves the nutritional value and digestibility of legume forages but also significantly boosts milk productivity and quality in lactating cows. This research underscores the potential of integrating biological preservatives in livestock feeding strategies to optimize dairy production, particularly in regions where legume forages are prevalent.

The authors tested a range of dietary fibers, including those derived from lucerne (Medicago sativa), soya beans, mung beans (Phaseolus mungo), chickpeas (Cicer arietinum), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), and sunflower seeds, as well as lignins and pectin. \n\nThe results indicated that only cholestyramine and fibers from lucerne, soya beans, mung beans, chickpeas, spinach, and sunflower seeds exhibited significant bile salt adsorption, specifically sodium cholate and sodium deoxycholate. This finding contradicts previous assertions that lignin was primarily responsible for bile salt binding, as no significant adsorption was detected from lignin or other tested fibers such as wheat bran and rolled oats. The authors hypothesized that the presence of saponins, which are known to be surface-active compounds, may facilitate the binding of bile salts to these fibers.\n\nThe study employed various analytical methods to quantify bile salt concentrations, including colorimetric assays, conductance measurements, and density assessments, with the colorimetric method being less reliable than the physical methods. The adsorption isotherms for cholestyramine followed a Langmuir-type model, while lucerne fiber exhibited a BET-type isotherm, suggesting differences in their adsorption mechanisms.\n\nThe authors concluded that the ability of certain plant fibers to adsorb bile salts is likely linked to their saponin content, which may enhance the cholesterol-lowering effects of dietary fiber. This is supported by the observation that dietary saponins can lower cholesterol levels in experimental animals. The study highlights the potential of saponin-containing plant materials in dietary strategies aimed at reducing serum cholesterol levels and suggests further exploration of the interactions between dietary fibers and bile salts in the context of cardiovascular health. \n\nOverall, the findings contribute to the understanding of how specific plant components can influence lipid metabolism and underscore the importance of dietary fiber in managing cholesterol levels."}

Two experimental series were performed, with the first focusing on a soya-bean meal-based diet and the second on a barley-based diet. Each beverage was incorporated at a concentration of 1 liter per 500 g of dry matter.\n\nThe results indicated that both tea varieties and coffee significantly impaired true protein digestibility (TD) and biological value (BV) in both diets, with black tea exhibiting the most pronounced negative effects. Specifically, TD decreased from 0.880 to 0.847 with black tea in the soya-bean meal diet, while BV dropped from 0.753 to 0.644. In contrast, cocoa powder, despite being indigestible, did not adversely affect protein or energy utilization metrics.\n\nThe authors attributed the detrimental effects of tea and coffee to their high tannin content, which is known to have anti-nutritional properties. Tannin concentrations were notably high in black tea (300 g/kg DM) and green tea (195.5 g/kg DM), leading to speculation that these compounds may interfere with protein digestion and absorption. The study corroborated previous findings that tea and coffee can reduce the digestibility of vegetable proteins while potentially enhancing the utilization of animal proteins.\n\nAdditionally, the study highlighted that the amino acid digestibility of soya-bean meal and barley was negatively impacted by the inclusion of tea and coffee, particularly affecting the limiting amino acids such as methionine and lysine. The authors noted that the complex interactions between tannins and proteins could be responsible for these reductions in digestibility and utilization.\n\nAnalytical methods employed included standard chemical analyses for dry matter, nitrogen, energy, and amino acids, alongside statistical analyses to evaluate the significance of the results. The findings underscore the importance of considering the effects of commonly consumed beverages on nutrient metabolism, particularly in the context of dietary protein sources.\n\nOverall, this research provides valuable insights into the interactions between dietary components and highlights the potential implications for nutrition and feeding strategies, particularly in animal husbandry and human dietary practices. The study suggests that while cocoa may not pose a risk to protein utilization, the consumption of tea and coffee warrants caution due to their negative impact on protein digestibility and overall nutrient absorption."}

Over a 21-day feeding trial, rats were fed diets with 0 to 450 g of freeze-dried haricot beans per kg of diet, with the bread providing the primary source of dietary polysaccharides.\n\nThe digestibility of NSP was significantly higher in haricot beans (0.86) compared to wholemeal bread (0.56). The individual components of NSP, particularly arabinose, xylose, and uronic acids, exhibited high digestibility rates (0.98, 0.88, and 0.99, respectively). In contrast, cellulose digestibility was low for both food sources (0.16 for bread and 0.25 for beans). RS was not consistently detected in feces, suggesting complete fermentation in the large bowel (LB).\n\nThe inclusion of haricot beans led to a marked increase in organic matter flow to the LB, resulting in significant caecal hypertrophy and alterations in volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles. The absorption of VFA from the LB increased fivefold with the highest bean inclusion, correlating with elevated concentrations of VFA in portal and heart blood. Notably, the presence of beans did not significantly affect the digestibility of bread NSP, indicating that the beans' impact was primarily additive rather than interactive.\n\nThe study utilized multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques to estimate digestibility separately for wholemeal bread and haricot beans, confirming that the addition of beans did not alter the digestibility of bread NSP. The results highlighted the potential of haricot beans as a valuable dietary component, enhancing the fermentative capacity of the gut and increasing the availability of energy through VFA absorption.\n\nOverall, the findings underscore the nutritional benefits of incorporating haricot beans into diets, particularly in enhancing the digestibility of complex carbohydrates and promoting gut health through increased fermentation activity. This research has implications for dietary recommendations and food formulations aimed at improving human nutrition and health outcomes."}

Twenty-four Large White x Landrace pigs, initially made hypercholesterolemic through a high-saturated fat diet supplemented with cholesterol, were assigned to four dietary groups receiving 0, 100, 200, or 300 g of baked beans per kg of diet for 28 days.\n\nResults indicated a significant reduction in total plasma cholesterol levels, with reductions of 5.3%, 20.2%, and 35.6% for the 100, 200, and 300 g/kg baked bean diets, respectively. Notably, only the 300 g/kg diet achieved statistical significance (P < 0.05) compared to the control. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol fraction was particularly affected, showing a significant reduction of 48% at the highest bean inclusion level. In contrast, levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triacylglycerols remained unchanged across treatments.\n\nLiver analyses revealed that diets containing 200 and 300 g/kg of baked beans significantly reduced liver cholesterol by approximately 50% compared to the control, although total liver lipid content did not differ significantly among groups. The study suggests that the soluble fiber content of baked beans, which comprises 8.2% of the total non-starch polysaccharides, may play a crucial role in lowering cholesterol levels, aligning with previous findings on the cholesterol-lowering properties of legumes.\n\nThe study's methodology included comprehensive blood sampling and lipid analysis through automated enzymatic assays and differential ultracentrifugation for lipoprotein fractionation. The statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Student's t-test, ensuring robust comparisons between treatment groups.\n\nThese findings contribute to the understanding of dietary interventions for managing hypercholesterolemia and suggest that baked beans may be an effective dietary component for reducing LDL cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic individuals. Future research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms by which baked beans exert these effects, including potential impacts on cholesterol synthesis and excretion.

The researchers prepared six distinct diets from bean flours with varying contents of resistant starch (RS), non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), and non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDO). The flours were derived from beans processed through different methods, including intact-cell flour (ICF), damaged-cell flour (DCF), high-oligosaccharide flour (HOF), and low-oligosaccharide flour (LOF).\n\nThe results showed that the total fermentability of indigestible carbohydrates was high across all diets (80-87%). Notably, RS from ICF was fermented more efficiently (97-99%) compared to retrograded starch from LOF (86-95%). The study also revealed that non-starch glucans were fermented to a lesser extent than RS, with autoclaved beans yielding higher fermentability than boiled beans.\n\nThe SCFA profile was characterized by a significant presence of butyric acid, which averaged around 18% of total SCFA in the caecum. Diets high in RS led to increased butyric acid concentrations in the distal colon, suggesting a potential health benefit, as butyric acid is known to serve as an energy source for colonocytes and may play a role in preventing colonic diseases. The ICF diet, which had the highest RS content, resulted in a notably higher percentage of butyric acid (24%) in the distal colon compared to the LOF + rafﬁnose diet (12%).\n\nThe study employed various analytical methods, including scanning electron microscopy to assess the structural integrity of the flours, and gas-liquid chromatography for SCFA quantification. The findings indicate that the type and processing of bean flour significantly influence the fermentation dynamics and SCFA production in the hindgut, highlighting the potential of red kidney beans as a functional food source for enhancing gut health.\n\nIn conclusion, the research underscores the importance of dietary fiber composition and structure in modulating gut fermentation and SCFA production, with implications for dietary recommendations aimed at improving colonic health and preventing diseases. Further studies are warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying these effects and the potential for optimizing bean processing methods to enhance their health benefits."}

The research highlights the complexity of breeding programs and the necessity for optimal resource allocation to enhance genetic gains, particularly in the context of increasing global food demands.\n\nUsing the QU-GENE platform, the authors simulated various breeding scenarios involving five selection strategies (mass selection, bulk breeding, single seed descent, pedigree method, and modified pedigree method) across three breeding frameworks (conventional breeding, speed breeding, and genomic selection) with different parental population sizes (15, 30, 60, and 100). The study found that the optimal breeding scenario varied significantly depending on the trait being selected. For instance, single seed descent yielded the highest genetic gain per cycle for days to flowering, while bulk breeding was most effective for white mold tolerance. In contrast, seed yield improvements were best achieved using single seed descent, the pedigree method, or the modified pedigree method.\n\nThe simulations revealed that relative genetic gains per cycle could reach up to 8.69% for seed yield under optimal conditions. The analysis of variance indicated that both the selection strategy and the parental population size significantly impacted genetic variance and allele fixation rates. Notably, genomic selection maintained genetic variance more effectively than conventional breeding, while speed breeding demonstrated the potential to accelerate genetic gains by reducing generation intervals.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) illustrated distinct clustering patterns among the selection strategies, with the pedigree method often correlating with higher fixation rates of favorable alleles. However, it was also noted that while the pedigree method was efficient in terms of allele fixation, it did not consistently yield the highest genetic gains compared to other strategies.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of trait heritability and the number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in determining the success of breeding programs. For example, traits with low heritability, such as seed yield, benefited from larger parental populations, while traits with fewer QTLs, like white mold tolerance, achieved optimal results with smaller populations.\n\nIn conclusion, this research provides valuable insights for breeders aiming to maximize genetic gain in dry bean breeding programs. The findings emphasize the need for tailored breeding strategies based on specific traits and environmental conditions, ultimately contributing to improved food security and agricultural sustainability."}

The study evaluates four irrigation technologies—motorized pumps (MP), treadle pumps (TP), water cans (WC), and gravity-fed surface irrigation (GR)—against a control group utilizing residual moisture (RM).\n\nKey findings indicate that irrigation technologies requiring less than 2 labor hours per cubic meter of water applied are optimal for small-scale farmers. The study calculated aggregated labor costs at $893 per hectare and labor-day thresholds at 2,978 LD per hectare. An irrigation supply of 7,000–10,000 m³ per hectare is deemed adequate, with recommendations for 400–600 m³ per irrigation event, applied every 5–7 days.\n\nThe results highlight significant yield differences across irrigation methods, with GR yielding the highest average output (2,278 kg/ha for dwarf beans and 1,713 kg/ha for climbing beans), while RM produced the lowest (522 kg/ha and 350 kg/ha, respectively). The dwarf bean line BCMV-B2 outperformed the climbing line IZ-301-1 in water use productivity (WUP), averaging 0.35 kg/m³ compared to 0.23 kg/m³ for the climber. Water use efficiency (WUE) varied, with WC showing the highest WUE (1.08 m³/m³), although this was accompanied by the highest labor costs, making it less economically viable.\n\nThe study underscores the necessity for fuel subsidies for farmers using MP due to high operational costs. It also emphasizes the importance of efficient water management practices to enhance crop yields and food security in the context of increasing land pressure and climate change. The authors advocate for further research on diverse bean lines across different agro-ecologies in Malawi, utilizing technologies that demonstrate high yields and water use efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the editorial posits that while irrigated agriculture is crucial for improving bean production in Malawi, the economic feasibility of various irrigation technologies must be carefully considered to support smallholder farmers effectively. The findings suggest that TP, MP, and GR technologies are preferable for enhancing yield and revenue, provided that operational costs are managed through appropriate support systems."}

The research identifies and quantifies free and conjugated phytosterols, including stigmasterol, campesterol, and β-sitosterol, using HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS–TOF) and UV-visible detection methods.\n\nKey findings reveal that black bean seed coats contain significant levels of acylated steryl glycosides (ASG) and steryl glycosides (SG), with β-sitosterol being the most abundant phytosterol, present at 51.2 mg/100 g after hydrolysis. The study demonstrates that extracts from black bean seed coats significantly inhibit cholesterol micellar solubility, outperforming stigmasterol as a control. This inhibition is attributed to the synergistic effects of both free and conjugated phytosterols.\n\nIn vitro experiments using primary rat hepatocytes show that these phytosterols downregulate lipogenic proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), while upregulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), a key enzyme in β-oxidation. The phytosterol extract also reduces the activation of liver X receptor (LXR), which is known to stimulate lipogenesis, thereby suggesting a mechanism by which these compounds may lower hepatic cholesterol levels.\n\nThe study highlights the potential of black bean seed coats as a functional food ingredient that could contribute to cholesterol management and cardiovascular health. The findings underscore the importance of ASG and SG in enhancing the bioactivity of phytosterols, suggesting that their consumption may provide health benefits, particularly in populations at risk for hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases.

The analysis indicates that RI is, on average, 12.31% less efficient than NF, but its effectiveness varies significantly based on environmental conditions, soil management practices, and soil characteristics.\n\nKey findings include that RI outperforms NF in specific contexts: during the dry season, under no-tillage systems, and in soils with high organic matter content. Notably, RI was more effective than NF in dry conditions, suggesting that biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) can be a viable alternative to chemical fertilizers, particularly in regions where water availability is limited. The study also highlights that RI's efficiency improves in soils with clay textures, eutrophic conditions, low to neutral acidity, and adequate phosphorus availability, particularly when using at least 10 g of inoculum per kg of seeds.\n\nThe analysis further reveals that RI significantly enhances nodulation characteristics, with increases of 19.04% in the number of nodules per plant and 37.03% in nodule dry mass compared to control treatments. In contrast, NF negatively impacts these nodulation metrics, reducing nodulation by 73.08% and 88.46%, respectively. This suggests that while NF promotes vegetative growth, it may inhibit the beneficial microbial activity necessary for effective BNF.\n\nThe study categorizes the effects of RI and NF based on various factors, including growing season, soil type, and management practices. For instance, in Oxisols, RI increased seed yield by 19.09% compared to NF, while in Ultisols and Entisols, RI resulted in lower yields. The findings underscore the importance of soil management, with no-tillage systems showing a positive correlation with RI effectiveness.\n\nIn conclusion, while RI can significantly enhance common bean productivity, it does not match the immediate yield benefits of NF under all conditions. The research advocates for the integration of RI in sustainable agricultural practices, particularly in regions conducive to BNF, to reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers and mitigate environmental impacts. Future research is encouraged to explore the genetic diversity of Rhizobium strains and their interactions with various common bean cultivars to optimize BNF efficiency further."}
{"doi": "10.1094_PDIS-02-18-0332-PDN", "summary": "This meta-analysis investigates the yield and fertilizer benefits of maize (Zea mays) intercropped with six annual grain legumes (soybean, common bean, groundnut, cowpea, pea, and faba bean) across China and Africa, highlighting the differences in agricultural practices and outcomes between these regions. Data from 73 publications were analyzed to assess land equivalent ratio (LER), yield gain, and nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer equivalent ratios (NFER and PFER).\n\nThe study found that intercropping significantly enhances land use efficiency, with overall LER values exceeding 1 for both regions. The average yield gain was 1.45 ± 0.07 t ha⁻¹, with China achieving a higher mean yield gain of 2.3 ± 0.13 t ha⁻¹ compared to Africa's 0.90 ± 0.07 t ha⁻¹. Relay-strip intercropping was particularly effective in China, while maize/common bean intercrops yielded the highest gains in Africa. Notably, increasing nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer rates negatively impacted LER in both regions, although phosphorus application improved yield gains in Africa but reduced them in China.\n\nThe analysis revealed that maize/legume intercropping systems can reduce fertilizer use, with NFER and PFER values indicating significant fertilizer savings. The study emphasizes that while intercropping can mitigate environmental issues associated with excessive fertilizer use in China, African farmers could benefit from moderate phosphorus applications to enhance productivity.\n\nThe findings suggest that different legume species offer varying yield and income benefits, with common bean emerging as a promising option for African farmers. The study advocates for the adoption of strip or relay-strip intercropping systems in Africa, alongside improved soil fertility management practices, to enhance food security and farmer income. In contrast, Chinese farmers are encouraged to diversify legume planting while minimizing nitrogen fertilizer use to optimize intercropping benefits.\n\nThis research provides critical insights into the potential of maize/legume intercropping as a sustainable agricultural practice, addressing the pressing challenges of food security and environmental sustainability in both China and Africa. Future studies should focus on optimizing intercropping designs and exploring the genetic potential of legumes to further enhance yield and nutrient efficiency in these systems."}

The study evaluates four irrigation technologies: motorized pumps (MP), treadle pumps (TP), water cans (WC), and gravity-fed surface irrigation (GR), alongside a control group utilizing residual moisture (RM).\n\nKey findings indicate that irrigation technologies requiring less than 2 labor hours per cubic meter of water applied are optimal for small-scale farmers. The aggregated labor costs for bean production were approximately $893 per hectare, with labor days totaling 2,978 per hectare. The study recommends an irrigation supply of 7,000–10,000 m³ per hectare per season for TP, MP, and GR, with each irrigation event requiring 400–600 m³ of water, applied every 5–7 days.\n\nYield analysis revealed significant differences across irrigation methods, with GR yielding the highest mean production (2,278 kg/ha for BCMV-B2 and 1,713 kg/ha for IZ-301-1), while RM resulted in the lowest yields (522 kg/ha for BCMV-B2 and 350 kg/ha for IZ-301-1). The dwarf bean line BCMV-B2 demonstrated superior water use productivity (WUP) compared to the climbing line IZ-301-1, averaging 0.35 kg/m³ versus 0.23 kg/m³, respectively. Water use efficiency (WUE) ranged from 0.15 m³/m³ for GR to 1.08 m³/m³ for WC, indicating that while WC had high efficiency, its labor costs were prohibitive.\n\nLabor requirements varied significantly, with WC demanding the highest labor input (3,931 labor days/ha), making it less economically viable despite its high WUE. Conversely, MP had the lowest labor costs ($300/ha) but required fuel subsidies to offset operational expenses, highlighting the financial constraints faced by smallholder farmers.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of efficient water management in enhancing bean yields and food security in Malawi, particularly under the pressures of climate change and increasing land pressure. It advocates for further research on diverse bean lines across different agro-ecologies, utilizing the most effective irrigation technologies to optimize yields and resource use. The findings underscore the necessity for support systems, such as fuel subsidies for MP users, to improve the economic viability of irrigation practices among small-scale farmers."}

The research aims to quantify the antioxidant capacity and component profiles of these vegetables, as well as to explore the correlations between antioxidant capacity and its constituent components.\n\nThe methodology involved lyophilizing and grinding the fresh vegetable samples to prepare ethanolic extracts. These extracts were subjected to assays to measure antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content, β-carotene, and ascorbic acid levels. The study utilized statistical analyses to assess the significance of the findings, particularly focusing on the relationships between antioxidant activity and the measured components.\n\nResults indicated that string beans exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity among the vegetables tested (p < 0.05). Conversely, snow peas demonstrated significantly elevated levels of total phenolics, ascorbic acid, and β-carotene compared to the other vegetables (p < 0.05). Notably, a significant positive correlation was observed between scavenging activity and the antioxidant components analyzed, suggesting that higher concentrations of these components may enhance antioxidant activity. However, an unexpected negative correlation was identified between overall antioxidant activity and its components, indicating a complex interaction that warrants further investigation.\n\nThe originality of this research lies in its contribution to the limited data available on the antioxidant capacities of non-leafy vegetables. The findings underscore the potential of these vegetables as significant sources of antioxidants, which may have implications for dietary recommendations and public health. The study also suggests that beyond the measured antioxidant components, other phytochemicals present in these vegetables could play a role in their overall antioxidant capacity.\n\nIn conclusion, this research highlights the nutritional value of non-leafy vegetables in terms of their antioxidant properties, emphasizing their potential benefits in human health. Future studies could expand on these findings by exploring the bioavailability of these antioxidants and their effects on human health, as well as investigating the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the observed antioxidant activities.

The research aims to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with yield traits under drought and irrigated conditions, addressing the critical issue of drought stress that significantly impacts bean production in developing regions.\n\nThe genetic mapping utilized a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the F5 generation of the cross, employing a combination of molecular markers including amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and 60 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The resulting genetic map spanned 1,087.5 cM across 11 linkage groups, with an average marker density of one marker every 5.9 cM. Notably, gaps larger than 15 cM were present on linkage groups b03, b09, and b11, indicating areas for potential further exploration.\n\nQTL analysis revealed a total of 49 QTL associated with yield, yield per day, seed weight, days to flowering, and days to maturity across three years of trials. The majority of QTL were identified for seed weight (27 QTL), followed by yield per day (12 QTL) and yield (10 QTL). The QTL for days to flowering and maturity were also significant, with overlapping loci suggesting pleiotropic effects. The most impactful QTL for seed weight explained up to 31% of the phenotypic variance, highlighting its importance as a trait under drought conditions.\n\nThe study underscores the quantitative inheritance of all traits analyzed, with transgressive segregation observed for yield and seed weight, indicating that some RILs outperformed both parental lines. The findings suggest that both BAT477 and DOR364 contribute beneficial alleles for drought tolerance traits, with implications for breeding programs aimed at improving drought resistance in common beans.\n\nIn conclusion, this research provides a valuable genetic resource for the Mesoamerican common bean genepool, facilitating future breeding efforts focused on enhancing drought tolerance and overall yield potential. The integration of various marker systems into a cohesive genetic map enhances the ability to conduct QTL analysis, thereby advancing the understanding of the genetic basis of drought resistance in common beans."}
{"doi": "10.1111_jfpp.13587", "summary": "In this study, García-Fernández et al. (2024) investigate the genetic control of pod morphological traits (PMTs) and edible pod characteristics (EPC) in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between the dry bean cultivar ‘TU’ and the snap bean cultivar ‘Musica’. The research identifies 35 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PMTs across seven chromosomes, with significant colocation on chromosomes Pv01 and Pv06, which are critical for pod phenotype modulation. The study also reveals two major loci for EPC, indicating a complex genetic architecture underlying these traits.\n\nThe phenotypic analysis of the TUM RIL population demonstrated a wide variation in pod traits, including pod length (PL), width (PLW), thickness (PTH), seed number per pod (NSP), and seed weight (SW). High heritability estimates (ranging from 0.88 to 0.99) suggest that these traits are predominantly controlled by genetic factors. Correlation analysis indicated significant positive relationships among most PMTs, particularly between PL, PLW, and pod shape (PSH/PSW).\n\nQTL mapping revealed that the highest number of QTL for PMTs was located on chromosome Pv01, with notable regions (R1.1, R1.2, R1.3) contributing to multiple traits. The most significant QTL, PL6.1TUM on Pv06, explained 26% of the phenotypic variation for PL. The study also identified 15 consensus QTL regions by comparing newly identified QTL with previously reported ones, enhancing the understanding of the genetic basis for pod morphology in common beans.\n\nFor EPC, the analysis indicated that two independent loci on Pv01 (EDIBILITY1TUM) and Pv06 (EDIBILITY6TUM) are responsible for the edible pod phenotype, with a proposed recessive inheritance model. The association study using a subset of the Spanish Diversity Panel corroborated the involvement of these loci in determining pod edibility.\n\nGene ontology enrichment analysis highlighted a significant overrepresentation of genes associated with the phenylpropanoid metabolic process in regions linked to PMTs, suggesting a role in lignin biosynthesis, which is crucial for pod structure and integrity. Conversely, genes related to auxin response were enriched in regions associated with EPC, indicating their potential involvement in pod wall fiber deposition and overall pod quality.\n\nThis research contributes valuable insights into the genetic control of pod traits in common beans, emphasizing the importance of chromosomes Pv01 and Pv06 in breeding programs aimed at improving snap bean quality. The findings underscore the complex interplay between pod morphology and edibility, driven by a network of genetic factors that can be leveraged for targeted breeding strategies."}
{"doi": "10.1136_bmj.281.6240.578", "summary": "In this study, Jenkins et al. (1980) investigated the postprandial blood glucose responses to dried legumes compared to various carbohydrate-rich foods, including grains, breads, and tubers. The research involved healthy volunteers consuming 50-g carbohydrate portions of eight varieties of dried legumes and 24 common carbohydrate foods. Results demonstrated that the mean peak blood glucose concentration and the area under the glucose curve for leguminous seeds were significantly lower—by at least 45%—than those for other tested foods.\n\nThe study highlighted that dried legumes, particularly beans, produced a notably flatter glycemic response, suggesting their potential utility in dietary management for individuals with impaired carbohydrate tolerance, such as diabetics and those with hypertriglyceridemia. The authors noted that the high fiber content and the resistant starch characteristics of legumes likely contributed to their lower glycemic impact, as these factors can modulate the rate of carbohydrate release from the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe experimental design included a controlled setting where subjects underwent glucose tolerance tests to ensure comparability across food groups. Blood samples were taken at multiple time points post-consumption, and glucose levels were analyzed using a glucose oxidase method. The findings indicated that the mean glucose area and peak rise after consuming beans were significantly lower than those after grains, breads, biscuits, and tubers, with specific reductions quantified (e.g., 51% lower than grains, 45% lower than biscuits).\n\nThe study also noted that while most leguminous seeds exhibited similar glycemic responses, exceptions were observed with marrowfat peas and soya beans, which had higher and lower responses, respectively. The authors emphasized the importance of dietary fiber in the context of diabetes management, citing previous research that linked high-fiber diets to improved glycemic control and reduced urinary glucose loss.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors advocate for the inclusion of dried legumes in dietary recommendations for individuals with diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, as they provide a means to increase carbohydrate intake while potentially lowering fat consumption and improving overall metabolic health. This research underscores the need for further exploration of legumes in dietary strategies aimed at managing chronic metabolic conditions."}

The research aims to identify genotypes that can simultaneously enhance both seed yield and the quality of crop residues (haulm + pod wall, HPW) for livestock nutrition.\n\nThe study measured seed and HPW yields, along with the morphological components of HPW, including total nitrogen (N), neutral detergent fiber (aNDFom), acid detergent fiber (ADFom), and dry matter digestibility (DMD). These attributes were analyzed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which demonstrated high predictive accuracy (R²v = 0.90-0.98, RPDv = 3.13-7.36) for the quality parameters.\n\nResults revealed significant genetic variation among common bean genotypes, with HPW yields ranging from 0.74 to 2.54 t/ha and seed yields from 0.79 to 2.62 t/ha across sites. Notably, genotype ECAB0081 exhibited the highest yields of both seed (3.47 t/ha) and HPW (3.36 t/ha) at the Shalla site, while the lowest yields were recorded for genotypes Argene and Loko. The study found that environmental factors significantly influenced both seed and HPW yields (P < 0.001), with genotype × environment interactions also affecting these traits (P < 0.05).\n\nThe composition of HPW varied considerably, with total N concentrations ranging from 7.7 to 11.4 g/kg DM, aNDFom from 648 to 739 g/kg DM, ADFom from 502 to 585 g/kg DM, and DMD from 467 to 570 g/kg DM. Genotype ECAB0081 consistently displayed superior quality attributes, including higher DMD (647 g/kg DM) and total N (12.5 g/kg DM). Correlations indicated that higher seed yields were associated with increased HPW yields (r = 0.92, P < 0.0001) and DMD (r = 0.68, P < 0.0001), suggesting that selection for seed yield could enhance the nutritional value of HPW.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential for breeding common bean genotypes that optimize both seed and HPW yields without compromising the nutritional quality of the residues. This dual-purpose approach is particularly relevant for smallholder farmers in East Africa, where crop residues serve as critical feed resources during dry seasons. The study advocates for integrating residue quality into breeding programs to improve the overall utility of common beans in sustainable agricultural systems."}
{"doi": "10.1155_2020_8876394", "summary": "This study investigates the genetic basis of seed hardness in black common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), a trait that significantly influences cooking time and canning quality. Utilizing a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between hard-seeded (H68-4) and soft-seeded (BK04001) parents, the research aimed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with seed hardness and develop molecular markers for breeding purposes.\n\nField trials conducted over three years (2014-2016) in southern Manitoba involved 85 RILs and the parental lines, assessing traits such as stone seed percentage (SSP) and hydration capacity (HC) using the AACC method 56-35.01. Cooking quality was evaluated through visual appeal assessments of cooked beans. Genotyping was performed using a genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) approach, resulting in the identification of 619 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for linkage mapping.\n\nQTL mapping revealed a major QTL on chromosome 7, previously associated with seed hydration, alongside two novel QTL on chromosomes 1 and 2 that significantly influenced SSP and HC. The QTL on chromosome 4 was linked to the visual appeal of cooked beans. Notably, seed hardness was characterized as an oligogenic trait with high heritability, indicating a strong genetic influence despite environmental variability. The study found that seed hardness traits were inherited independently from cooking quality, suggesting that breeding for these traits can be optimized separately.\n\nThe analysis also highlighted the Asp gene, known for its association with seed coat luster, which was mapped to chromosome 7. This gene's influence on water uptake and its potential role in seed hardness were discussed, although the study indicated that other genetic factors likely contribute to the observed traits. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of seed coats revealed differences in surface texture between the parental lines, supporting the hypothesis that seed coat characteristics may affect hydration and cooking quality.\n\nOverall, the identification of QTLs and the development of SNP markers provide valuable tools for the genetic improvement of common bean varieties, particularly in enhancing seed quality traits relevant to consumer preferences and processing efficiency. The findings underscore the importance of integrating genetic and phenotypic data to inform breeding strategies aimed at improving the culinary attributes of dry beans."}

The research highlights the significance of these genes in drought tolerance, a critical trait for common bean cultivation in arid environments.\n\nThe authors analyzed a collection of 401 accessions, comprising 104 wild and 297 cultivated beans, sourced from diverse ecological habitats ranging from semi-arid to desert conditions. They employed various molecular techniques, including PCR amplification and sequencing, to assess genetic variation at the Asr loci. The results revealed stark differences in nucleotide diversity between the two genes; Asr1 exhibited low diversity indicative of strong purifying selection, while Asr2 showed higher diversity, suggesting adaptive selection, particularly in wild populations.\n\nHaplotype analysis indicated that Asr2 had more haplotypes than Asr1, with wild beans displaying greater genetic variation than cultivated beans. The study found that polymorphic sites were predominantly located in introns and non-conserved regions, with all coding region mutations in Asr1 being synonymous. Notably, the authors identified significant deviations from neutrality for Asr2 in wild beans, suggesting that natural selection has shaped its genetic diversity.\n\nThe findings underscore the role of wild common bean as a reservoir of genetic variation, particularly for drought tolerance traits linked to the Asr gene family. The authors argue that this genetic diversity can be harnessed for breeding programs aimed at improving drought resistance in cultivated beans. They emphasize the importance of integrating wild germplasm into breeding strategies, given the historical selective pressures faced by wild beans in their native habitats.\n\nOverall, this research lays the groundwork for future association studies linking genetic polymorphisms in Asr genes to phenotypic traits related to drought tolerance, thereby contributing valuable insights for the development of resilient common bean varieties. The study highlights the potential of leveraging genetic resources from wild relatives to enhance the adaptive capacity of cultivated crops in the face of climate change."}

(2011) aimed to enhance the genetic toolkit for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) by developing gene-based simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from leaf and root tissues of two key genotypes: the Andean accession G19833 and the Mesoamerican accession DOR364. The research focused on the identification and characterization of SSRs, particularly in the context of abiotic stress responses, specifically low phosphorus conditions.\n\nThe authors sequenced a total of 3,123 ESTs, identifying 184 microsatellites, predominantly consisting of tri-nucleotide motifs (53.8%), with di-nucleotide motifs being the second most common (30.9%). The study revealed that the majority of di-nucleotide SSRs were AGn, while tri-nucleotide SSRs included frequent motifs such as AAG, AGG, and ACC. The analysis indicated that leaf-derived ESTs had a slightly higher SSR frequency (6.9%) compared to root-derived ESTs (5.1%), although the overall differences in SSR type and frequency between the two tissues were minimal.\n\nFrom the identified SSRs, the authors developed 120 new BMc markers, augmenting the existing BMc series to a total of 368 markers. These markers were evaluated for their ability to distinguish genetic diversity among a germplasm panel of 18 genotypes, which included both cultivated and wild accessions. The average polymorphism information content (PIC) for the new markers was 0.310, indicating a moderate level of genetic diversity.\n\nThe study's findings underscore the utility of gene-based microsatellites in genetic mapping and diversity analysis, particularly in the context of breeding programs aimed at improving common bean resilience to abiotic stresses. The authors emphasize the potential of these markers for future studies, including association mapping and functional diversity analysis, which could facilitate the selection of traits linked to stress resistance and nutritional quality.\n\nOverall, this research contributes significantly to the understanding of microsatellite distribution in common bean and provides a valuable resource for genetic studies and breeding efforts, particularly in underrepresented genotypes such as G19833 and DOR364. The integration of these new markers into existing genetic frameworks will enhance the capacity for molecular breeding and the exploration of genetic diversity within the species."}

The randomized 4 × 4 crossover trial involved 17 participants (9 men and 8 women) aged 35-70 years, all diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and managed through metformin or lifestyle changes. The meals tested included white long-grain rice as a control and combinations of pinto beans, black beans, and dark red kidney beans with rice, all standardized to provide 50 grams of available carbohydrates.\n\nResults indicated that the inclusion of beans significantly lowered postprandial blood glucose levels compared to rice alone. Specifically, at 90, 120, and 150 minutes post-meal, net glucose values were significantly reduced for the pinto and black bean combinations, with incremental area under the curve (iAUC) values also showing significant reductions for these meals compared to the rice control. The dark red kidney bean combination did not exhibit significant differences in glycemic response, suggesting variability in the glycemic impact of different bean types.\n\nThe study highlights the nutritional benefits of beans, which are rich in fiber, protein, and phytochemicals, potentially acting as natural α-glucosidase inhibitors. The low glycemic index (GI) of beans (GI values: pinto 45, black 20, kidney 20) contrasts sharply with the high GI of white rice (GI ~80), underscoring the importance of combining these foods to mitigate glycemic spikes. The findings support the notion that culturally relevant dietary patterns, such as the traditional bean and rice meal, can be beneficial for glycemic control in diabetic populations, promoting adherence to dietary recommendations.\n\nThe study's implications extend beyond glycemic management, suggesting that traditional foods can enhance dietary compliance among culturally diverse groups. The authors advocate for the inclusion of culturally appropriate foods in diabetes management strategies, emphasizing the need for further research into the specific mechanisms by which different bean varieties influence glycemic responses. This research contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the role of legumes in chronic disease prevention and management, particularly in populations with dietary restrictions or cultural food preferences."}

The research aimed to assess whether the higher Fe content in the biofortified beans translates to improved Fe absorption, particularly in the context of addressing global Fe deficiency anemia.\n\nThe experimental design involved feeding broiler chickens diets formulated with either the standard or biofortified beans for six weeks, while measuring hemoglobin (Hb) levels, liver ferritin, and gene expression of Fe transporters (DMT-1, Dcyt-B, and ferroportin). Despite the higher Fe concentration in the biofortified beans, the results indicated that hemoglobin maintenance efficiency (HME) was significantly higher in the standard bean group during the initial weeks, suggesting a compensatory response to lower dietary Fe. Final total body Hb-Fe content was marginally greater in the biofortified group (26.6 mg) compared to the standard group (24.4 mg), but no significant differences were observed in liver ferritin or gene expression of Fe transporters between the two groups.\n\nIn vitro assessments of Fe bioavailability revealed low absorption rates from both bean varieties, attributed to high levels of polyphenolic compounds that inhibit Fe absorption. Notably, the biofortified beans exhibited higher concentrations of polyphenols such as kaempferol, catechin, myricetin, and quercetin 3-glucoside, which are known to chelate Fe and reduce its bioavailability. The study highlighted that while biofortified beans are a promising source of dietary Fe, the elevated polyphenolic content may counteract the nutritional benefits of increased Fe concentration.\n\nThe findings suggest that breeding efforts aimed at increasing Fe content in black beans may inadvertently elevate polyphenolic levels, thereby limiting Fe bioavailability. The authors recommend further investigation into the polyphenolic profiles of these beans and potential modifications to enhance their nutritional quality. This research underscores the complexity of biofortification strategies and the need to balance Fe content with factors that influence its bioavailability, particularly in staple crops consumed by populations at risk of Fe deficiency."}

The research focuses on two cacao bean types: unfermented Mexican Lavado beans and fermented Ivory Coast beans, both subjected to roasting and grinding through traditional and modern methods.\n\nThe traditional processing involved roasting whole beans on an earthenware comal heated by charcoal, followed by de-shelling and grinding with a stone metate. In contrast, the modern method utilized pilot-scale equipment, including drum roasters and mechanical grinders. The antioxidant capacity and flavanol content were analyzed using the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for flavanol monomers (±-epicatechin and ±-catechin), oligomers (DP 1–10), and total flavanols.\n\nResults indicated that unprocessed Mexican Lavado beans exhibited significantly higher antioxidant capacity and flavanol content compared to the fermented Ivory Coast beans. Notably, the processing methods did not yield significant differences in antioxidant and flavanol levels for the unfermented Lavado beans, suggesting that both traditional and modern techniques maintain similar flavanol profiles. However, for the fermented Ivory Coast beans, traditional processing resulted in higher levels of epicatechin and flavanols (DP 1–10) compared to modern processing, attributed to differences in final roast temperatures and fermentation uniformity.\n\nThe study highlights that traditional processing may preserve certain beneficial compounds better than modern methods, particularly for fermented beans. The findings suggest that the preference for unfermented Lavado beans among Mesoamerican cultures may be linked to their higher flavanol content, which is associated with cardiovascular health benefits. The research underscores the need for further exploration into the impact of processing methods on the nutritional quality of cacao products, particularly in the context of consumer health and product flavor profiles. \n\nOverall, this work contributes valuable insights into the biochemical implications of cacao processing methods and their relevance to health benefits, emphasizing the importance of traditional practices in maintaining the nutritional integrity of cacao."}

(2024) conducted a comprehensive study on the phenotypic and yield responses of five common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties to varying soil moisture levels, specifically focusing on drought and waterlogging stress. The research aimed to elucidate the morphological mechanisms that enable these varieties to tolerate moisture fluctuations, which is critical given the increasing challenges posed by climate change.\n\nThe experimental design involved a pot trial with five common bean varieties—Hirna, Kufanzik, Awash-1, Ado, and Chercher—subjected to three moisture treatments: optimal, waterlogging, and moisture deficit. The study revealed significant interactions between moisture levels and varieties affecting growth parameters, including leaf fresh weight, dry weight, leaf area, and overall yield components.\n\nKey findings indicated that the Hirna variety exhibited extended flowering and pod-setting periods under moisture stress, delaying these stages by up to 24 days compared to other varieties. Waterlogging stress notably reduced fresh and dry weights, leaf area, and overall biomass more severely than moisture deficit conditions. In terms of yield, the Hirna and Kufanzik varieties demonstrated higher resilience, producing greater grain yields and harvest indices compared to Chercher, Awash-1, and Ado.\n\nThe study utilized various analytical methods, including statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the impact of moisture levels on phenological traits such as days to flowering, pod formation, and physiological maturity. Results showed that moisture stress significantly delayed flowering and pod formation in sensitive varieties like Hirna, while Kufanzik and Ado maintained more stable phenological responses.\n\nThe research also highlighted the importance of leaf relative water content (LRWC) as a physiological indicator of stress response. Under moisture deficit, LRWC decreased significantly, correlating with increased leaf temperatures, which suggests impaired water uptake and potential stress-induced physiological changes. The study emphasized that varieties with higher leaf thickness and robust root systems, such as Hirna and Kufanzik, exhibited better drought tolerance, likely due to enhanced water retention and nutrient uptake capabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings underscore the phenotypic plasticity of common bean varieties in response to moisture stress, with Hirna and Kufanzik identified as promising candidates for breeding programs aimed at improving drought resistance and yield stability under fluctuating environmental conditions. This research contributes valuable insights into the genetic and physiological traits that can be leveraged for the development of resilient common bean cultivars in the face of climate change."}

Results indicated that increasing rates of N application led to a decrease in nodule number (NN) and nodule dry weight (NDW) across all soil types. Notably, the 20 kg N ha−1 treatment, both alone and with Rhizobium inoculation, resulted in the highest nodulation, particularly in soils with a high indigenous rhizobial population.\n\nThe study revealed that Rhizobium inoculation significantly improved yield and yield traits compared to uninoculated treatments, with the highest total biomass yield (TBY) and grain yield (GY) observed in soils with small and medium rhizobial populations when combined with 100 kg N ha−1. Conversely, in soils with a large rhizobial population, lower N rates (20 and 40 kg N ha−1) yielded the best results. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of Rhizobium inoculation is contingent upon the indigenous rhizobial population present in the soil, which affects the nitrogen fixation capacity of common beans.\n\nAdditionally, the study highlighted that the total plant tissue nitrogen (PTTN) was highest at 20 kg N ha−1 in soils with low rhizobial populations, while higher N applications tended to suppress PTTN. The research underscores the complexity of nitrogen requirements for common beans, indicating that both indigenous and inoculated rhizobia play crucial roles in achieving optimal yields.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors advocate for a tailored approach to nitrogen management in common bean cultivation, emphasizing the need for Rhizobium inoculation alongside strategic inorganic N application based on the indigenous rhizobial population.

Furthermore, treated plants exhibited increased fresh and dry weights of roots and shoots, indicating enhanced growth.\n\nThe study utilized a comprehensive methodology, including the isolation of Ra and TO from the rhizosphere of bean plants, followed by in vitro antagonism assays and greenhouse experiments to assess disease severity and plant growth metrics. Statistical analyses confirmed significant differences among treatments, underscoring the effectiveness of the biocontrol agents.\n\nThe identification of Ra as a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family and TO as a recently characterized Trichoderma species adds to the novelty of the findings. The research suggests that the dual application of these biocontrol agents could serve as a viable strategy for managing common bacterial blight, particularly in regions lacking resistant bean cultivars.\n\nThe authors propose that further investigations into the mechanisms of action of Ra and TO, including their roles in inducing systemic resistance and promoting plant growth, are essential for optimizing their application in sustainable agriculture. This study contributes to the growing body of literature advocating for biological control methods in crop protection, emphasizing the need for integrated pest management strategies that minimize reliance on chemical inputs.\n\nIn conclusion, the synergistic application of R. aquatilis and T. orientale presents a promising avenue for the biological control of common bacterial blight in beans, with implications for enhancing crop productivity and sustainability in agricultural practices. Future research should focus on field trials and the exploration of additional strains to maximize the efficacy of these biocontrol agents."}

The research aimed to assess the efficacy of extrusion processing in mitigating heat-labile anti-nutrients while evaluating the nutritional benefits of these legumes.\n\nThe experimental design included four dietary treatments: a control diet and three bean-based diets (40% BB, PB, or WB). The results indicated that hamsters consuming the BB diet exhibited weight gain comparable to those on a low-fat chow diet, while total plasma cholesterol levels were significantly lower (298-356 mg/dL) than the control (365 mg/dL). Notably, liver cholesterol levels were reduced by approximately 50% and 33% for total and free cholesterol, respectively, in hamsters fed BB and PB diets. \n\nFecal analysis revealed that nitrogen content was 2.6 times higher in PB and WB diets compared to controls, with increased excretion of bile acids, specifically deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), across all legume-fed groups. This suggests that the consumption of these beans enhances bile acid excretion, potentially contributing to cholesterol-lowering effects.\n\nExtrusion processing was confirmed to effectively eliminate anti-nutritional factors, enhancing protein and carbohydrate digestibility. The proximate analysis of the beans revealed protein contents of 27.1% (BB), 24.6% (PB), and 25.1% (WB), with total dietary fiber (TDF) levels of 16% (BB), 27% (PB), and 28% (WB). The study highlighted that the BB diet, despite having lower TDF, was supplemented with microcrystalline cellulose to balance fiber content.\n\nPlasma lipoprotein profiles indicated that the BB diet significantly lowered VLDL and LDL levels, while all bean diets resulted in reduced HDL cholesterol. The liver lipid content was also lower in all bean-fed hamsters, reinforcing the hypocholesterolemic properties of legumes. The findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying these effects may involve increased bile acid excretion and modulation of lipid metabolism, potentially influenced by gut microbiota interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, the study demonstrates that extruded black, pinto, and white beans can effectively lower hepatic lipids and improve lipid profiles in hamsters on high-fat diets, supporting their potential role in dietary strategies aimed at obesity and hyperlipidemia management. The research underscores the importance of extrusion processing in enhancing the nutritional quality of legumes while mitigating anti-nutritional factors."}

(2010) focuses on the environmental stratification of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genotypes in the Brazilian states of Paraná and Santa Catarina, specifically targeting carioca grain types. The research aimed to evaluate grain yield across 20 trials using a randomized block design with three replications, involving 16 carioca genotypes. The authors employed five methodologies for environmental stratification: Lin's traditional method, mean square of interaction for paired locations, complex interaction percentage estimation, Pearson’s correlation, and Wricke's ecovalence method.\n\nThe results indicated significant genotype-environment (GE) interactions, which are crucial for breeding programs as they affect genotype performance across varying environmental conditions. The study identified locations that were uninformative based on at least three methodologies, specifically excluding Roncador (rainy/dry 2003) and Laranjeiras do Sul (rainy 2004) from future evaluations. The analysis revealed that Roncador was consistently identified as uninformative across multiple seasons, leading to its elimination from the evaluation network.\n\nThe mean grain yield across trials varied significantly, ranging from 985 to 3946 kg ha^-1, attributed to geographical diversity and differing cropping systems. The coefficient of variation was between 7% and 19%, indicating good experimental accuracy. The stratification analysis revealed that certain locations, such as Campos Novos and Major Vieira, exhibited non-significant GE interactions, suggesting their suitability for future evaluations.\n\nThe methodologies applied provided insights into the nature of GE interactions. For instance, Lin's method grouped locations with non-significant interactions, while the ecovalence analysis highlighted locations contributing least to the interaction, thus guiding the selection of informative sites for breeding trials. The study concluded that maintaining a network of evaluation sites is essential for accurately assessing common bean genotypes, particularly in light of the strong influence of GE interactions observed.\n\nOverall, this research underscores the importance of environmental stratification in breeding programs, facilitating the identification of optimal testing locations that reflect the environmental diversity of common bean cultivation in southern Brazil. The findings are relevant for enhancing breeding strategies aimed at improving yield stability and adaptability of common bean cultivars in varying environmental conditions."}

The research highlights the increasing incidence of IgE-mediated food allergies, particularly to legumes, and aims to identify sensitization patterns and cross-reactivity among commonly consumed legumes.\n\nA cohort of 355 patients with a history of legume allergy underwent skin prick tests (SPT) with ten legume extracts. The results indicated that kidney bean was the most significant allergen, sensitizing 22% of patients, followed by chickpea (18%) and peanut (15%). The study established a strong correlation between SPT positivity and specific IgE (sIgE) levels (r = 0.85, p < 0.0001), with elevated sIgE levels observed in 89.7% of kidney bean-sensitive individuals. Basophil histamine release assays demonstrated that sera from kidney bean-sensitive patients induced histamine release ranging from 16% to 54%, correlating significantly with both SPT (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001) and sIgE levels (r = 0.99, p < 0.0001).\n\nImmunoblotting revealed eight major IgE-binding allergens from kidney bean, with molecular weights of 58, 50, 45, 42, 40, 37, 34, and 18 kDa. Notably, boiling kidney beans resulted in the loss of high molecular weight allergens, indicating heat sensitivity. Mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) identified four key allergens: phytohemagglutinin (lectin), phaseolin, an alpha-amylase inhibitor precursor, and a group 3 late embryogenesis abundant protein, all of which are associated with allergenic responses.\n\nCross-reactivity studies demonstrated that kidney bean allergens exhibited significant cross-reactivity with peanut, black gram, and pigeon pea, with the latter two requiring higher concentrations for IgE inhibition.

The research aims to identify potential sources of drought tolerance in wild beans that could be utilized in breeding programs for cultivated varieties, which are generally more susceptible to drought stress.\n\nThe authors employed two potential evapotranspiration (PET) models—Thornthwaite and Hamon—to estimate drought stress at the collection sites over the past fifty years. These models incorporate climatic variables such as temperature and radiation to predict water flux from the soil to the atmosphere. The study found that wild common beans are distributed across different precipitation regimes, with a notable latitudinal gradient in their ecological diversity. Wild accessions were found to occupy a broader range of drought-prone habitats compared to cultivated beans, suggesting a greater genetic reservoir for drought tolerance.\n\nThe analysis revealed five distinct sub-populations of wild common beans, each associated with specific ecological niches and precipitation patterns. The study also highlighted that the habitat drought stress index derived from both PET models was effective in correlating environmental data with genetic population structure, thereby aiding in the understanding of the evolutionary history and diversification of the species.\n\nKey findings include the identification of significant differences in drought tolerance between wild and cultivated beans, with wild populations exhibiting adaptations to arid conditions. The study emphasizes the importance of utilizing wild common beans in breeding programs to enhance drought resistance in cultivated varieties. The authors advocate for further exploration of genetic diversity within wild populations, as it holds promise for improving the resilience of common beans to climate change.\n\nOverall, this research contributes valuable insights into the ecological and genetic factors influencing drought tolerance in common beans, underscoring the potential of wild relatives as a resource for enhancing agricultural sustainability in the face of increasing drought conditions.

{"doi": "10.1371_journal.pone.0115673", "summary": "This study investigates the efficacy of intercropping annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), wheat (Triticum aestivum), oat (Avena sativa), and corn (Zea mays) to mitigate iron (Fe) deficiency chlorosis in dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) cultivated in high pH, calcareous soils. Conducted over two years (2009 and 2010) at the University of Wyoming, the research employed a two-factor factorial strip-plot randomized complete block design, comparing black and navy beans grown in monoculture versus intercropped with the aforementioned grasses.\n\nThe results indicated that while intercropping significantly increased chlorophyll intensity in dry beans, it did not enhance tissue Fe concentrations, suggesting that the beans were unable to efficiently utilize the Fe present in their tissues. In 2009, beans in monoculture exhibited higher nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and manganese (Mn) concentrations compared to those intercropped with grasses, which may have contributed to the observed Fe deficiency symptoms. Notably, the intercropped treatments resulted in a 25% reduction in dry bean yield compared to monoculture, with annual ryegrass being the least competitive among the grasses tested.\n\nThe study highlights the complex interactions between nutrient availability and plant competition. Although chlorophyll intensity was improved in intercropped beans, the overall yield was compromised due to competition for resources such as nutrients, water, and light. The authors suggest that the benefits of reduced chlorosis symptoms may be outweighed by the competitive disadvantages posed by the grasses, particularly in terms of yield.\n\nSoil analysis revealed that grass intercropping treatments generally led to lower soil NO3-N concentrations compared to monoculture, which aligns with previous findings that high NO3-N levels can exacerbate Fe deficiency chlorosis. The study underscores the need for further research to optimize grass and bean densities and to determine the optimal timing for grass removal to balance the benefits of reduced chlorosis with the potential for increased yields.\n\nIn conclusion, while intercropping with annual grasses can alleviate early-season chlorosis symptoms in dry beans, it does not guarantee improved yields, indicating a need for careful management strategies in future agricultural practices aimed at addressing Fe deficiency in calcareous soils. Further exploration of intercropping dynamics and nutrient management is warranted to enhance the sustainability and productivity of dry bean cultivation in affected regions."}

Anthracnose, caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, poses a significant threat to bean production, particularly in subtropical and temperate regions. The Co-4 locus is known to confer resistance to multiple races of this pathogen, making it a critical target for breeding programs aimed at enhancing disease resistance.\n\nA population of 94 F4:5 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between the resistant black bean genotype B09197, which carries the Co-42 allele, and the susceptible navy bean cultivar Nautica. The study utilized three SCAR markers linked to Co-4 and a panel of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for genotyping. The analysis revealed a refined physical region on chromosome Pv08, spanning 936.46 kb, associated with anthracnose resistance. A total of 32 unique annotated candidate genes were identified within this region, predominantly featuring leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and receptor-like kinase (RLK) domains, which are characteristic of plant disease resistance genes.\n\nNotably, three candidate genes exhibited similarity to 1,3-β-glucanase domains, suggesting a potential role in defense against fungal pathogens. The study also noted sequence similarities between some identified genes and previously characterized genes associated with other resistance loci, such as Co-x. This indicates that the Co-4 locus may consist of a complex arrangement of genes, including those involved in protein tyrosine kinase activity, LRRs, and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipases C.\n\nThe research employed various analytical methods, including high-throughput SNP genotyping and BLAST searches against the genomic sequence of common bean accession G19833, to identify candidate genes. The results suggest that the Co-4 locus is organized as a cluster of resistance genes, which may provide a durable form of resistance against C. lindemuthianum. The identification of tightly linked molecular markers associated with Co-4 enhances the potential for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs, facilitating the development of cultivars with improved resistance to anthracnose.\n\nIn conclusion, this study contributes valuable insights into the genetic basis of anthracnose resistance in common bean, highlighting the complexity of the Co-4 locus and the potential for utilizing identified candidate genes in breeding strategies aimed at enhancing disease resistance. Further research is warranted to elucidate the functional roles of these candidate genes and their interactions within the broader context of plant-pathogen dynamics."}

The study utilized deep sequencing of small RNAs (siRNAs) derived from pooled leaf samples to identify viral sequences, revealing that both endornaviruses were present in all sample pools from Nicaragua and in two of the three pools from Tanzania. Notably, the coverage of the viral genomes was high, ranging from 87.9% to 99.9%, indicating robust detection of these viruses.\n\nThe research highlights that while PvEV-1 and PvEV-2 are prevalent, pathogenic seedborne viruses such as Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) and Southern bean mosaic virus were largely absent, with only Cowpea mild mottle virus (CPMMV) detected in one Tanzanian sample pool. This low incidence of pathogenic viruses is attributed to the introduction of virus-resistant common bean varieties developed through breeding programs in both countries.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of the endornaviruses, which are known to be vertically transmitted through seeds but are not associated with symptoms in their hosts. The genomes of PvEV-1 and PvEV-2 were characterized, revealing conserved domains such as RNA helicase, glycosyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The research also notes that the presence of these endornaviruses could potentially interfere with the plant's physiology, although their exact impact remains unclear.\n\nThe analytical methods employed included small RNA deep sequencing, which provided a comprehensive approach to virus detection, allowing for the identification of both known and unknown viruses based on sequence homology.

Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and Bayesian clustering (STRUCTURE) identified three major groups: the Andean race Nueva Granada (large-seeded kidney beans), the Mesoamerican race (small-seeded navy, black, and small white beans), and the Durango race (medium-seeded pinto and great northern beans). Notably, the Mesoamerican cultivars were further categorized into three subgroups based on seed type, while the Andean cultivars were divided into two groups, with kidney beans forming a cohesive cluster.\n\nA significant finding was the overall reduction in genetic diversity from wild types to landraces and then to advanced cultivars, particularly pronounced in the Andean gene pool. The total number of alleles observed was 343, averaging 5.6 alleles per locus, with a mean expected heterozygosity (He) of 0.546. The study highlighted that the advanced cultivars exhibited lower genetic diversity compared to wild and landrace accessions, indicating a narrowing of the genetic base due to selective breeding practices.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of incorporating genetic variability from landraces into breeding programs to enhance the resilience and adaptability of common bean cultivars in the face of climate change and evolving market demands.

The study employed a factorial randomized complete block design with three replications, including treatments of simultaneous planting, planting at maize emergence, and planting at knee height, alongside two spatial arrangements: alternate and paired.\n\nKey findings indicate that spatial and temporal differentiation significantly influenced the agronomic attributes of common bean but not maize. At Adet, the highest grain yield of common bean (1.9 t ha⁻¹), land equivalent ratio (LER) of 1.99, and monetary advantage index (MAI) of 357 were achieved when common bean was planted simultaneously with maize in a paired arrangement. Conversely, at Finoteselam, maximum LER (1.61) and MAI (2.83) were recorded when common bean was intercropped at maize emergence in a paired arrangement. The study concluded that simultaneous planting of common bean with maize enhances land use efficiency and profitability without adversely affecting maize yields.\n\nThe research highlights the importance of optimizing planting times and spatial arrangements to improve intercropping systems, suggesting further investigation into the compatibility of various maize and common bean varieties under different conditions. The results underscore the potential of intercropping as a sustainable agricultural practice to enhance productivity in regions facing land scarcity and food security challenges. \n\nOverall, this study contributes valuable insights into the dynamics of maize-common bean intercropping, emphasizing the need for tailored agronomic practices to maximize yield and resource use efficiency in Ethiopian agriculture."}

{"doi": "10.14393_BJ-v36n1a2020-42441", "summary": "The study investigates the effects of glyphosate on the germination and vigor of common bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris) treated with a biostimulant. The research addresses the hypothesis that glyphosate residues in soil may negate the benefits of biostimulants or exacerbate herbicide damage. A completely randomized 2x5 factorial design was employed, with treatments including the presence or absence of a biostimulant and five reduced doses of glyphosate (0, 2.2, 4.4, 6.6, and 8.8 mL L^-1).\n\nKey findings indicate that biostimulant treatment significantly enhanced germination rates, seed vigor, and early seedling growth. However, the presence of glyphosate diminished these advantages, particularly at higher doses, evidenced by increased electrical conductivity, which suggests membrane damage. Notably, glyphosate application resulted in improved germination during the accelerated aging test, indicating a potential hormetic effect at lower concentrations.\n\nThe study measured various parameters, including first germination count, standard germination tests, accelerated aging, cold tests, root and shoot lengths, root and shoot dry mass, and electrical conductivity. Results showed that the biostimulant improved seed vigor, as reflected in higher percentages of normal seedlings and greater dry mass accumulation, particularly in the absence of glyphosate. However, the benefits were significantly reduced when glyphosate was present, especially at doses above 2.2 mL L^-1.\n\nThe authors discuss the biochemical mechanisms underlying these observations, noting that glyphosate disrupts the shikimic acid pathway, inhibiting the production of essential aromatic amino acids, which are crucial for protein synthesis and overall plant development. The biostimulant, likely containing growth hormones such as gibberellins, auxins, and cytokinins, promotes seedling vigor by enhancing cell division and elongation, as well as mobilizing energy reserves for germination.\n\nThe study concludes that while biostimulants can enhance seed performance, their efficacy is compromised in the presence of glyphosate, which poses a risk to seed germination and seedling establishment. The findings underscore the need for careful management of herbicide application in conjunction with biostimulant use to optimize crop performance in agricultural systems. This research contributes to the understanding of plant responses to herbicides and biostimulants, with implications for breeding and agricultural practices aimed at improving crop resilience and productivity."}

(2023), the agronomic and qualitative responses of early-cycle common bean cultivars—specifically IAC Nuance (speckled), IAC 1849 Polaco (Carioca), and IAC Veloz (black)—to varying doses of top-dressing nitrogen (N) were evaluated. The experiment utilized a randomized block design with a split-plot scheme, assessing N doses of 0, 60, 120, and 180 kg ha⁻¹.\n\nThe results indicated that IAC Veloz exhibited the highest grain yield, particularly at lower N doses, demonstrating its efficiency in N utilization. In contrast, IAC Nuance and IAC 1849 Polaco achieved maximum yields at 155 and 163 kg ha⁻¹ of N, respectively, with IAC Nuance showing a notable 25.3% increase in yield due to N application. Increasing N doses significantly enhanced sieve yield and crude protein content across cultivars, with IAC Nuance consistently performing well in grain quality metrics.\n\nThe study highlighted key agronomic traits, revealing that shoot dry matter production was highest in IAC Veloz, while leaf nitrogen content (LNC) was significantly influenced by both cultivar and N dose interactions. Notably, IAC Veloz maintained superior LNC even without N application, suggesting inherent soil fertility benefits from previous soybean cultivation. The number of pods per plant and grains per pod were also positively correlated with N application, particularly in IAC Veloz, which had the highest pod count.\n\nQualitative assessments revealed that IAC Nuance retained the most grains on sieves ≥11, indicating its market viability, while IAC 1849 Polaco and IAC Veloz demonstrated shorter cooking times and faster hydration rates. The cooking time varied significantly among cultivars, with IAC Nuance requiring the longest duration, while IAC Veloz had the shortest hydration time, making it favorable for culinary applications.\n\nStatistical analyses, including principal component analysis, indicated that sieve yield and crude protein content were the most discriminative factors among cultivars, while hydration time was independent of other variables. The findings underscore the importance of cultivar selection and N management in optimizing both yield and quality in common bean production, with implications for breeding programs aimed at enhancing nutrient efficiency and consumer preferences.\n\nOverall, this research contributes valuable insights into the agronomic performance and quality attributes of common bean cultivars under varying nitrogen fertilization regimes, highlighting the potential for improved breeding strategies and agricultural practices in Brazil's diverse bean production landscape."}

The study highlighted a positive correlation between agronomic traits—such as total dry matter and leaf relative water content (RWC)—and grain yield, indicating that wider planting distances and adequate nitrogen fertilization enhance physiological performance and yield.\n\nStatistical analysis confirmed significant effects of both planting distance and nitrogen levels on seed yield, total dry weight, and RWC at the 1% level. Specifically, the highest total dry weight (726.83 g/m²) was recorded at a planting distance of 20 cm, while the lowest (617.16 g/m²) was at 10 cm. The application of 100 kg N/ha also significantly improved total dry weight compared to the control treatment.\n\nThe study further examined phenological stages, noting that planting distance significantly influenced the duration of flowering, podding, and maturity stages. The longest growth duration (103 days) was associated with a planting distance of 25 cm, while the shortest (95 days) was at 10 cm. The interaction between planting distance and nitrogen application did not significantly affect these stages.\n\nThe authors recommend a combined agronomic practice of applying 100 kg N/ha and maintaining a planting distance of 25 cm for optimal management of Pinto bean crops in the Nili center of Daikundi province.

The research addresses the critical issue of nutrient deficiencies that limit common bean yields, which average less than 1 ton ha−1 in the region, despite potential yields of 2.5–3.0 tons ha−1 under optimal conditions.\n\nThe field experiment utilized a randomized complete block design with factorial arrangements, testing five rates of NPSB fertilizer (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg ha−1) alongside two Rhizobium strains (HB-A15 and HB-429, identified as Rhizobium etli) and a control without inoculation. Results indicated significant interactions between NPSB rates and Rhizobium strains affecting nodulation, grain yield, and aboveground biomass.\n\nKey findings include that the application of 150 kg NPSB ha−1 combined with Rhizobium etli inoculation yielded the highest grain yield of 3017.7 kg ha−1 and a net return of 38,298.55 ETB ha−1.

Notably, the response to N was more pronounced in the rainy season, attributed to lower initial N levels and a higher C/N ratio in the preceding crop's straw. The highest grain yield was recorded for IPR Tangará (4,498 kg ha^-1) during the rainy season, driven by a greater number of pods and grains per pod.\n\nThe study also assessed crude protein concentration, which varied inconsistently across cultivars and N rates. In the dry season, cultivars exhibited higher protein levels, likely due to better N uptake facilitated by lower C/N ratios in the preceding crop's straw. Conversely, the rainy season saw lower protein concentrations, particularly at intermediate N rates, suggesting a dilution effect from increased grain yield.\n\nAnalytical methods included statistical analyses of variance and regression to evaluate the effects of N rates on various parameters, revealing that while N application improved grain quality metrics such as relative sieved grain yield (RSGY) and sieve yield (SY), the influence on protein concentration was less consistent.\n\nOverall, this research underscores the importance of tailored N management strategies in common bean cultivation, highlighting cultivar-specific responses to N fertilization and the implications for breeding programs aimed at improving yield and nutritional quality.

(2022) provides a comprehensive analysis of the spontaneous fermentation process of cacao beans (Theobroma cacao) in Ivory Coast, emphasizing the role of various microorganisms and the biochemical transformations that occur during fermentation. The authors highlight that cacao beans, a vital agricultural product, undergo significant quality changes influenced by fermentation, which is critical for developing desirable flavor and aroma profiles in chocolate and other cacao-derived products.\n\nThe fermentation process is initiated by yeasts, primarily Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which metabolize sugars from the cacao pulp into alcohol and carbon dioxide under anaerobic conditions. This is followed by the aerobic phase, where lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as Lactobacillus plantarum and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) like Acetobacter pasteurianus convert the alcohol into organic acids, contributing to the flavor complexity. The review identifies a diverse range of microbial species involved in this process, including yeasts (e.g., Candida tropicalis, Pichia kudriavzevii), LAB, and AAB, with their populations varying by region and fermentation method.\n\nKey biochemical changes during fermentation include the degradation of sugars, proteins, and pectins, leading to the formation of aroma precursors such as free amino acids and volatile compounds. The authors note that the fermentation conditions—temperature, pH, and aeration—significantly affect microbial dynamics and the quality of the final product. Optimal fermentation typically occurs at a pH around 5.0, where the balance of acids and aroma compounds is favorable for high-quality cacao beans.\n\nThe review also discusses the importance of fermentation duration, which can range from 2 to 10 days depending on the cacao cultivar and environmental conditions. For instance, the Forastero variety requires longer fermentation times to develop its characteristic flavor profile compared to Criollo. The authors emphasize that improper fermentation can lead to undesirable off-flavors due to the activity of certain Bacillus species and excessive acidity.\n\nAnalytical methods such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) are referenced for identifying volatile compounds produced during fermentation, including aldehydes, esters, and alcohols, which contribute to the sensory attributes of cacao products. The review concludes by underscoring the need for further research into the microbial ecology of cacao fermentation and the potential for developing starter cultures to enhance flavor consistency and quality in cacao processing.\n\nOverall, this article provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of microorganisms during cacao fermentation and its implications for improving cacao quality, which is crucial for the food industry and agricultural practices in cacao-producing regions."}

The kefir supernatants were fermented for 24 and 48 hours and tested against seven bacterial strains, including *Pseudomonas syringae* and *Xanthomonas axonopodis*, using the disk diffusion method. Results indicated that antibacterial potency varied by kefir type and fermentation duration, with longer fermentation generally enhancing antimicrobial activity. Notably, kefir AN exhibited the highest efficacy against several pathogens.\n\nIn vitro results demonstrated that the antimicrobial effects of kefir supernatants were not solely due to low pH, as control experiments with lactic and acetic acids at similar pH levels showed no significant inhibition of bacterial growth. This suggests that other antimicrobial compounds produced during fermentation, such as organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and possibly bacteriocins, contribute to the observed antibacterial effects.\n\nIn vivo experiments were conducted in a climate chamber using cucumber and common bean plants inoculated with their respective pathogens. While the application of kefir supernatant did not significantly reduce disease severity, it positively influenced plant growth parameters. Specifically, common bean plants showed increases of 22% in shoot fresh weight and 113% in root dry weight, while cucumber plants exhibited a 34% increase in root fresh weight. These results imply that kefir supernatants may enhance plant growth, potentially due to the presence of bioactive compounds that support plant metabolism.\n\nThe study highlights the potential of kefir as a natural biocontrol agent in agriculture, particularly in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance among plant pathogens. Future research is warranted to isolate and identify specific antimicrobial compounds within kefir and to explore their mechanisms of action. This could lead to the development of novel, sustainable strategies for managing bacterial diseases in crops, aligning with the growing interest in natural product applications in both agriculture and medicine."}

The experimental design included six treatments: three trellis systems (double rows on individual strings, single row on individual strings, and single row on synthetic net) and three intercropping systems with common maize, sunflower, and Jerusalem artichoke.\n\nKey findings indicate that the single row trellis system on individual strings (V2) yielded the highest production, averaging 3,610 kg ha⁻¹ in the first year and 3,170 kg ha⁻¹ in the second year. In contrast, intercropping with Jerusalem artichoke (V6) resulted in the lowest yields (1,684 kg ha⁻¹ and 1,189 kg ha⁻¹, respectively). The study also revealed that the number of pods per plant ranged from 8 to 17, with the highest number associated with the single row trellis system (V3). \n\nChemical analysis of the runner bean dry seeds showed that crude protein content varied significantly across treatments, with values ranging from 22.65% (V6) to 25.47% (V3). Crude fat content was highest in the intercropping with sunflower (V4) at 2.16%, while crude fiber ranged from 5.41% (V4) to 5.81% (V5). The nitrogen-free extractive substances were highest in V4 (64.92%) and lowest in V3 (62.11%).\n\nPhenological observations indicated that the intercropping systems did not significantly alter the developmental phases of runner beans, with the entire growth cycle lasting approximately 130-140 days. However, shading from intercropped plants, particularly Jerusalem artichoke, delayed certain phenological phases by 1-3 days, which correlated with reduced yield.\n\nThe study employed spectrophotometric methods to assess chlorophyll content, revealing that intercropped plants had higher chlorophyll concentrations, likely as an adaptive response to lower light availability. This adjustment, however, did not translate into improved yield due to the detrimental effects of shading on pod and seed development.\n\nIn conclusion, the research underscores the potential of runner bean cultivation under different trellis and intercropping systems, with the single row trellis system on individual strings proving most effective for maximizing yield and seed quality. The findings contribute valuable insights for optimizing runner bean production in temperate climates, particularly in the context of sustainable agricultural practices. Future research may explore the genetic basis for yield variation and the potential for breeding programs aimed at enhancing drought resistance and nutritional quality in runner beans."}

Conducted in Selvíria, MS, during the winter of 2003, the experiment utilized a randomized block design with a 2x7 factorial arrangement, assessing the effects of nitrogen application (absence vs. presence of 75 kg ha^-1) and various herbicide application methods.\n\nKey findings indicate that nitrogen topdressing significantly enhanced dry matter production (DMP), weed control percentage (WC), and grain yield (YIE) of the common bean. Specifically, the presence of nitrogen led to a DMP of 9.5 g plant^-1 compared to 5.6 g plant^-1 in its absence, and improved weed control from 65% to 85%. The study also noted that the application of urea (6%) in conjunction with herbicides increased their effectiveness in weed management without adversely affecting the agronomic performance of the beans.\n\nThe herbicides fluazifop-p-butyl, an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor targeting grasses, and fomesafen, a protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor for broadleaf weeds, were applied at varying rates (150 + 120 g ha^-1 and 225 + 180 g ha^-1). The results showed that higher doses of these herbicides, particularly when combined with urea, resulted in increased phytotoxicity, which was quantified through visual assessments. However, the agronomic parameters such as the number of pods per plant (NPP), number of grains per plant (NGP), and mass of 100 grains (MHG) remained unaffected by the herbicide application methods.\n\nStatistical analyses revealed significant interactions between nitrogen application and herbicide methods for weed control, but not for yield components. The study concluded that nitrogen topdressing is beneficial for enhancing the growth and yield of common beans, while the strategic application of urea can improve herbicide efficacy in weed management. These findings underscore the importance of integrated nutrient and weed management strategies in optimizing common bean production.\n\nOverall, this research contributes to the understanding of how nitrogen fertilization and herbicide application can be synergistically utilized to improve the agronomic performance of common beans, addressing challenges in weed management and nutrient efficiency in Brazilian agriculture. Further studies are suggested to explore the long-term effects of these practices on soil health and crop sustainability."}

(2015), the efficacy of various nitrogen (N) fertilizer sources on the yield of irrigated common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was evaluated under no-till conditions in the Cerrado biome of Brazil. The experiment, carried out in winter 2010 at Embrapa Arroz e Feijão, involved a randomized block design with five replicates, testing five nitrogen sources: conventional urea, urea with the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), polymer-coated urea, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium nitrate, alongside a control treatment without nitrogen.\n\nKey parameters assessed included the Relative Chlorophyll Index (IRC), nitrogen content and accumulation in the plant, dry matter weight of the aerial part (MSPA), number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, 100-seed mass, and overall grain yield. The results indicated no significant differences among the nitrogen sources regarding IRC, MSPA, nitrogen content, or nitrogen accumulation. Notably, the use of polymer-coated urea and urea with NBPT did not enhance the number of seeds per pod, number of pods per plant, 100-seed mass, or grain yield compared to traditional nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium nitrate.\n\nThe study highlighted that while the IRC was influenced by the interaction of treatments and evaluation periods, the overall nitrogen accumulation and productivity metrics did not show significant improvements with the newer fertilizer formulations. The highest grain yield recorded was 2,528 kg ha^-1 with polymer-coated urea, which was only significantly different from the control treatment.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of emerging nitrogen fertilizers in specific agricultural contexts, particularly in the Cerrado, where soil conditions may influence nitrogen availability and plant response. The study concludes that traditional nitrogen sources remain effective for common bean cultivation under the tested conditions, suggesting that the anticipated benefits of slow-release and stabilized nitrogen fertilizers may not be realized in all scenarios. This research contributes to the understanding of nitrogen management in legume cultivation and informs future breeding and agronomic practices aimed at optimizing yield in similar environments."}

Conducted in Pato Branco, Brazil, the research utilized a 2 x 4 factorial design with four Mo doses (0, 40, 80, and 120 g ha^-1) applied via sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4) to evaluate shoot dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) accumulation in cover crops, as well as nitrate reductase (NR) activity in common beans.\n\nResults indicated that sunn hemp exhibited a linear increase in both shoot DM and N accumulation with increasing Mo doses, achieving a maximum of 34.19 t ha^-1 DM and 545.49 kg N ha^-1 at the highest Mo application. Conversely, jack bean displayed a quadratic negative response in DM accumulation, with no significant N accumulation observed. Notably, NR activity in common beans was significantly higher in the control treatment (0 g ha^-1 Mo) compared to Mo-treated plants, suggesting that Mo application may inhibit NR activity under certain conditions.\n\nDespite the positive effects of Mo on sunn hemp, common bean productivity was not significantly influenced by Mo doses or cover crop treatments, with an average yield of 1,917 kg ha^-1, below the cultivar's potential of 3,950 kg ha^-1. This lack of productivity response may be attributed to environmental factors, particularly insufficient rainfall during critical growth stages.\n\nThe study highlights the differential responses of cover crops to Mo application, with sunn hemp benefiting from increased nutrient accumulation, while jack bean did not show similar advantages. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the interactions between micronutrient applications and legume cover crops in enhancing soil fertility and subsequent crop performance. Furthermore, the research contributes to the limited literature on the role of Mo in cover crops, suggesting potential avenues for optimizing nitrogen management in agricultural systems through strategic use of molybdenum. \n\nIn conclusion, while foliar Mo application improved N accumulation in sunn hemp, it did not translate into enhanced common bean productivity, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the timing and environmental conditions affecting these interactions."}

The research involved 17 common bean genotypes, including nine carioca and eight black beans, evaluated across four experiments conducted over two years in southern Brazil. The traits assessed included grain color (L*, a*, b*), absorption percentage, normal grains, cooking time, mass of 100 grains, and concentrations of six minerals (potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and copper).\n\nStatistical analyses revealed a significant genotype × experiment interaction for all traits except potassium concentration, indicating that environmental factors significantly influence trait expression. Cluster analyses using Tocher’s method and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) were employed to classify genotypes based on data from one to four experiments. Results showed that while both methods effectively differentiated genotypes using data from a single experiment, the use of data from four experiments provided a more nuanced understanding of differences in grain lightness and brightness, particularly for the L* value, which was the most significant trait contributing to genetic divergence.\n\nThe study found that Tocher’s method identified three groups when using data from one experiment, primarily separating carioca from black bean genotypes. However, with data from four experiments, five distinct groups emerged, allowing for a more detailed classification based on grain quality traits and mineral content. The UPGMA method also confirmed the separation of genotypes into two main groups based on grain type, with high cophenetic correlation coefficients indicating strong reliability in clustering patterns.\n\nKey findings include the identification of L* as a critical descriptor for differentiating between carioca and black bean genotypes, with significant implications for breeding programs focused on grain quality and nutritional value.

The research utilized caecal content from New Zealand White rabbits to assess fermentation characteristics through an in vitro gas production technique, providing insights into the nutritive value of these forages.\n\nKey findings revealed that common vetch silage exhibited the highest crude protein (CP) content (179 g/kg DM), followed by faba bean (157 g/kg DM) and bean silages (146 g/kg DM), while barley silage had the lowest CP (96 g/kg DM). The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents were significantly lower in bean and common vetch silages compared to others, indicating a more favorable fiber profile for digestion. Ryegrass silage demonstrated superior dry matter degradation, organic matter degradation, and gas production parameters, suggesting its high fermentability and energy potential.\n\nThe study employed a completely randomized experimental design with three replicates per treatment, analyzing 189 incubation bottles to determine gas production kinetics. The parameters assessed included asymptotic gas production (B), rate of gas production (C), lag time, dry matter degradability (DMD), organic matter degradability (OMD), gas yield at 24 hours (GY24), digestible energy (DE), and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations. Notably, ryegrass and common vetch silages produced higher gas volumes and SCFA concentrations, correlating with their favorable chemical compositions.\n\nCorrelation analyses indicated a negative relationship between CP and the B parameter, while NDF and ADF showed negative correlations with lag time and microbial crude protein (MCP) production. Conversely, these fiber components positively correlated with DMD, OMD, DE, and relative gas production (RGP), highlighting the impact of fiber composition on fermentation efficiency.\n\nThe authors conclude that the in vitro gas production technique effectively characterizes the fermentative digestion process in rabbits, with common vetch and bean silages showing the highest digestible energy values.

Conducted in greenhouse conditions, three experiments utilized biochars produced from rice husk, sawdust, and sorghum silage, with varying concentrations (0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10% v/v) applied to the soil. The results demonstrated that biochar significantly enhanced root dry mass, shoot dry mass, grain dry mass, number of pods, and number of grains, indicating its potential as a valuable soil amendment.\n\nThe biochars were characterized chemically, revealing differences in pH, nutrient content, and yield. For instance, biochar from rice husk filter (BRHF) had a pH of 6.8 and contained 14.4 g kg^-1 organic carbon, while sawdust filter biochar (BSF) exhibited a higher organic carbon content of 430.4 g kg^-1 and a pH of 7.1. The application of biochar improved soil properties, including nutrient availability and cation exchange capacity, which are crucial for enhancing plant growth, particularly in acidic tropical soils.\n\nStatistical analysis showed that the optimal biochar concentrations for maximizing root and shoot dry mass were approximately 6.52% for BRHF, 5.84% for BSF, and 7.11% for sorghum silage filter biochar (BSSF). The maximum dry mass of grains reached 18.73 g plant^-1 with 10% BRHF, while BSF and BSSF yielded 17.57 g and 18.60 g, respectively, at their optimal concentrations. Additionally, nutrient concentrations in leaves increased linearly with biochar doses, suggesting enhanced nutrient uptake.\n\nThe study also noted that biochar application positively influenced physiological traits, such as relative water content and leaf osmotic potential, which could lead to improved stress tolerance. However, it highlighted a potential trade-off, as biochar application appeared to down-regulate genes associated with plant defense mechanisms, indicating a complex interaction between growth promotion and stress response.\n\nThese findings underscore the agronomic benefits of utilizing biochar from organic waste, not only as a nutrient source but also for improving soil health and crop productivity. The authors advocate for further research to optimize biochar application rates and explore its long-term effects on soil and plant health, particularly in the context of sustainable agriculture and waste management. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights into the role of biochar in enhancing common bean cultivation, with implications for broader agricultural practices in tropical regions."}

Results indicated that no genotype outperformed the control cultivars in terms of yield across the seasons. Notably, the dry season produced grains with superior color, while the rainy season resulted in the shortest cooking times. The genotypes BRS Esteio, BRS Esplendor, and IAC Imperador demonstrated resistance to all three diseases evaluated, while lighter-colored grain genotypes tended to be more susceptible to anthracnose and Fusarium wilt.\n\nYield analysis revealed that the mean yields were lowest in the rainy season (2111 kg ha−1) compared to the dry (2268 kg ha−1) and winter (2476 kg ha−1) seasons. The BRS Esteio and Gen C2-1-6-1-1 genotypes were among the highest yielding in the dry season, while BRS Pérola and Gen C2-1-6-1-1 excelled in the winter season. The study also highlighted that the IAC Imperador and BRS Esplendor cultivars consistently exhibited resistance to the evaluated pathogens.\n\nCooking time assessments indicated that certain genotypes, such as Gen C2-1-6-1 and BRS Cometa, had significantly shorter cooking times compared to controls, particularly in the rainy season. The cooking times varied from 26’51” to 32’10” across the three seasons, influenced by genetic and environmental factors.\n\nColorimetric analysis of grain color (L* values) showed that genotypes with lighter seed coats, such as Gen C2-1-6-1, were preferred in the market but were generally more susceptible to diseases. The study noted that the presence of polyphenolic compounds, which contribute to grain darkening and disease resistance, may be reduced in lighter-colored grains, thereby impacting their susceptibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the study did not identify any genotypes superior to the controls for yield, it successfully characterized the agronomic and market-related traits of the evaluated genotypes, providing valuable insights for future breeding programs focused on disease resistance and consumer preferences in common beans.

This indicates a genotype-specific response to Zn fertilization.\n\nNutrient analysis showed that soil Zn application influenced leaf concentrations of nitrogen (N), calcium (Ca), and sulfur (S), while foliar Zn application affected manganese (Mn) levels. Notably, the nutrient export rates from the experimental site followed the order: N > K > P > Ca ≈ S > Mg for macronutrients and Fe > Mn > Cu > Zn for micronutrients. Foliar Zn application enhanced the export rates of Zn, P, Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Cu, and Fe in IPR Campos Gerais, while soil Zn application increased P, K, and Mn exports in BRS Esteio.\n\nThe study underscores the critical role of Zn in plant metabolism, including gene regulation, protein synthesis, and photosynthesis, and highlights the importance of understanding nutrient dynamics in common bean cultivation, particularly under no-till systems. The findings suggest that while foliar Zn can enhance leaf nutrient concentrations, it may have adverse effects on grain yield in certain cultivars, emphasizing the need for tailored fertilization strategies in bean breeding programs aimed at improving yield and nutritional quality.

The genetic gain was calculated using Vencovsky’s method (1988), adapted for biennial evaluations.\n\nResults indicated significant genetic variability among genotypes for most traits, with a notable negative genetic gain for both mass of 100 grains (-2.91% per year) and water absorption (-0.55% per year). Conversely, the L* value and cooking time exhibited no significant genetic gain, suggesting a plateau in these traits. The majority of evaluated lines met consumer preferences, with carioca beans achieving L* values ≥ 53 and black beans ≤ 22, alongside a mass of 100 grains ranging from 20 to 25 g and fast cooking times (≤ 25 min).\n\nThe study highlights that while the new cultivars exhibit high technological quality, the observed declines in grain mass and water absorption raise concerns about the sustainability of breeding strategies.

Key metrics evaluated included shoot dry weight (SDW), root dry weight (RDW), number of nodules (NN), and yield components such as pods per plant (PPL) and grains per pod (GP).\n\nIn greenhouse conditions, all microbial treatments exhibited similar performance, with Burkholderia sp. 10N6 and R. tropici showing notable results in terms of biomass production. Specifically, treatments with R. tropici and Burkholderia sp. 10N6 yielded comparable SDW and RDW to those receiving mineral nitrogen. However, in field conditions, R. tropici and the co-inoculation of R. tropici with T. asperellum and B. subtilis (IRTBa) significantly increased SDW and RDW, demonstrating a 67.3% increase in SDW compared to the non-inoculated control.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of nodulation, with treatments involving R. tropici and its combinations leading to higher NN and nodule dry weight (NDW), indicating enhanced nitrogen fixation capabilities. Notably, the IRT treatment yielded the highest grain yield (3185.50 kg ha-1), surpassing the control with nitrogen fertilization.\n\nStatistical analyses, including ANOVA and principal component analysis, revealed that while greenhouse results indicated a strong correlation between microbial inoculation and growth metrics, field results displayed greater variability, likely due to environmental factors and soil microbiome interactions. The findings suggest that co-inoculation strategies can effectively promote sustainable agricultural practices by reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers while enhancing crop productivity.\n\nIn conclusion, the study provides compelling evidence that combined inoculation with R. tropici, T. asperellum, and PGPR can significantly enhance growth and yield in common beans, with implications for improving agricultural sustainability and food security. Further research is warranted to explore the interactions among these microorganisms and their effects across diverse environmental conditions."}

The research involved seven legume species categorized into three economic uses: purely green manures (sunn hemp, Crotalaria juncea; velvet bean, Stizolobium aterrimum), forage legumes (Campo Grande stylo, a mix of Stylosanthes captata and Stylosanthes macrocephala; calopo, Calopogonium mucunoides), and grain legumes (common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris; cowpea, Vigna unguiculata; peanut, Arachis hypogaea). The study aimed to assess total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents, microbial biomass, soil respiration, and metabolic quotients before and after the application of green manures and subsequent corn planting.\n\nResults indicated that while total C and N contents remained stable post-harvest, C-microbial biomass significantly increased in soils treated with grain and purely green manures, correlating with higher shoot and root dry mass. Basal soil respiration decreased after corn harvest across all treatments, yet metabolic stress was notably higher in soils with forage legumes. The microbial quotient suggested effective degradation of organic matter across all treatments, despite the increased metabolic stress observed in forage species.\n\nSoil sampling was conducted at three intervals: before legume seeding, after legume harvest, and after corn harvest. The experimental design utilized a randomized complete block approach, with soil chemical characterization performed prior to legume seeding. The study employed methods such as dry combustion for C and N quantification, and microbial biomass was estimated using the extraction-irradiation method. Soil respiration was measured according to established protocols, and metabolic and microbial quotients were calculated to assess microbial efficiency.\n\nKey findings include the superior performance of sunn hemp and velvet bean in terms of N accumulation and microbial biomass restoration, suggesting their efficacy as green manures. The study also highlights the potential for these legumes to enhance soil health and fertility without the need for synthetic fertilizers, reinforcing their role in sustainable agricultural practices. The research underscores the importance of selecting appropriate legume species based on their economic use to optimize soil microbiological benefits and crop productivity in tropical agroecosystems.\n\nIn conclusion, the study demonstrates that different legume green manures can maintain soil C and N levels post-corn harvest, with purely and grain legumes promoting higher microbial abundance compared to forage legumes, which exhibited greater metabolic stress. These findings contribute valuable insights for sustainable agricultural practices in tropical regions, emphasizing the role of legume green manures in enhancing soil health and crop yields."}

The research involved creating a base population through crosses among ten high-nutrient parents, yielding 351 progenies. After two selection generations, 27 superior progenies were evaluated across two field trials for FeC, ZnC, 100 seed weight, and yield.\n\nHeritability estimates for the four traits ranged from 59% to 94%, indicating significant genetic control and potential for selection. The expected gains from direct selection for FeC and ZnC were between 3% and 21%, with simultaneous selection yielding gains of 1% to 4%. Notably, eight selected progenies outperformed the Brazilian black bean cultivar ‘BRS Supremo’ by 10% for FeC and 8% for ZnC, demonstrating the efficacy of the recurrent selection approach.\n\nThe study employed rigorous statistical analyses, including analyses of variance and genetic parameter estimation, confirming the presence of genetic variability among progenies. The mean FeC and ZnC values of selected progenies were 75.5 mg·kg–1 and 40.1 mg·kg–1, respectively, surpassing those of the check cultivar. The results indicate a strong potential for developing new lines with enhanced nutritional profiles while maintaining agronomic performance.\n\nThe research highlights the importance of simultaneous selection for multiple traits, as the eight best progenies exhibited superior agronomic traits alongside high nutrient concentrations. The study concludes that the recurrent selection population possesses high genetic variability and is capable of producing lines that exceed current market cultivars in both nutritional and agronomic quality.\n\nFuture work will involve recombining the eight selected progenies with two external lines specifically developed for high FeC and ZnC, aiming to initiate a new recurrent selection cycle.

The research highlights the potential of KPhi as an alternative to conventional fungicides, which can adversely affect beneficial microbial communities.\n\nThe experimental design included treatments with KPhi, a phenylurea fungicide, and controls (both inoculated and uninoculated seeds). Key metrics assessed were the emergence speed index (ESI), total emergence percentage, number of nodules per root system, dry nodule mass, and nitrogen content in shoots. Results indicated that KPhi significantly improved ESI and total emergence (96.0%) compared to the inoculated control (68.5%), demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating the impact of R. solani.

The cultivars analyzed include BRS Ametista, BRS Notável, Pérola, BRS Esplendor, BRS Executivo, BRS Pitanga, and Jalo Precoce, developed by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation to enhance agricultural traits and nutritional value.\n\nThe beans exhibited significant variations in nutritional content. All cultivars demonstrated high dietary fiber levels, with total fiber ranging from 21 g/100 g (Pérola) to 24 g/100 g (BRS Ametista). The total phenolic compounds (TPC) were notably high across the genotypes, with Jalo Precoce showing the highest TPC at 9 mg GAE/g and antioxidant activity of 63 µmol Trolox/g. A strong positive correlation (r = 0.988, p < 0.05) between TPC and antioxidant activity was observed, underscoring the health benefits associated with these beans.\n\nProtein content varied among cultivars, ranging from 19 to 23 g/100 g, with BRS Executivo having the highest protein content. The amino acid profile revealed that glutamic acid and aspartic acid were the predominant non-essential amino acids, while lysine and leucine were the most abundant essential amino acids. However, all cultivars were deficient in methionine and cysteine, with amino acid scores (AAS) ranging from 0.8 to 2.6, indicating that while they provide a good source of protein, they require complementary food sources to achieve a complete amino acid profile.\n\nIn vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) varied significantly among the cultivars, with Jalo Precoce exhibiting the highest digestibility at 67%, while BRS Notável had the lowest at 50.3%. The presence of anti-nutritional factors, such as trypsin inhibitors, was also assessed, with BRS Pitanga showing the lowest trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) but a low IVPD, suggesting that other components may influence protein digestibility more than TIA alone.\n\nThe findings highlight the potential of these improved bean cultivars as a nutritious food source, rich in antioxidants and dietary fiber, while also emphasizing the need for processing techniques that retain their beneficial properties and mitigate anti-nutritional factors. This research contributes valuable insights for breeding programs aimed at enhancing the nutritional quality of common beans, which are vital for addressing protein malnutrition, particularly in developing regions."}

Conducted in a greenhouse, the research utilized biochar derived from rice husk, sawdust, and sorghum silage, which served as filtration materials for swine biofertilizer. The experimental design included five concentrations of biochar (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 L m−3) applied to an Oxisol, with four replicates per treatment.\n\nThe results demonstrated that biochar application significantly improved soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and nutrient availability. Specifically, the highest biochar concentrations increased soil pH by 0.76, 1.17, and 1.68 units for rice husk, sawdust, and sorghum silage biochar, respectively.

Specifically, the highest values for plant height (43 cm), number of leaves (49), leaf area index (6), number of pods (17), pod dry mass (63 g), pod mass per plant (18 g), and grain yield (2,230 kg ha-1) were recorded at 125% ETc, although no significant differences were noted between 100% and 150% ETc for most parameters. Conversely, irrigation levels of 25% and 50% ETc resulted in marked reductions in growth and yield, underscoring the detrimental effects of water deficit on common bean development.\n\nThe study employed multiple regression models to predict pod dry mass, total biomass accumulation, and grain yield based on growth variables, demonstrating a strong predictive capacity (R² values indicating good model fit). The findings emphasize the critical role of adequate irrigation in enhancing common bean productivity, particularly in regions susceptible to water scarcity. The research contributes valuable insights for agricultural practices, particularly in optimizing irrigation strategies to improve yield in common bean cultivation, which is vital for food security in low-income populations reliant on this crop as a primary protein source. \n\nIn conclusion, the study highlights that maintaining irrigation at 100% of ETc is essential for achieving optimal growth and yield in the 'Rosinha' common bean, while also providing a framework for utilizing growth metrics in predictive modeling for agricultural management."}

Conducted from April to December 2016 at the Federal University of Campina Grande, Brazil, the experiment aimed to assess the impact of incorporating leguminous green manures on lettuce production compared to mineral fertilization.\n\nSeven treatments were tested: mineral fertilization, and six leguminous species—Crotalaria juncea, Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean), Dolichos lablab (lablab bean), Cajanus cajan (pigeon pea), and a control with spontaneous vegetation. The experimental design was a randomized block with five replicates, and various growth parameters were measured 30 days post-transplanting, including leaf number, head diameter, shoot height, root volume, fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, and overall yield.\n\nResults indicated that the incorporation of lablab bean significantly enhanced lettuce growth and yield, achieving the highest total fresh weight (TFW) of 232.20 g and a yield of 27.91 t ha^-1. In contrast, treatments with spontaneous vegetation yielded the lowest results. The study highlighted that while other legumes like cowpea and pigeon pea also improved lettuce performance, none matched the effectiveness of lablab bean.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the leguminous species contributed to soil nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen (N), which is critical for lettuce growth. Lablab bean demonstrated a high nutrient content, with 46.73 g kg^-1 N, 6.45 g kg^-1 P, and 17.60 g kg^-1 K, which likely facilitated enhanced soil fertility and plant growth. The study also noted that green manure practices could reduce reliance on inorganic fertilizers, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nStatistical analysis using ANOVA and Tukey's test confirmed significant differences among treatments at a 0.05 probability level, underscoring the efficacy of leguminous green manures in improving lettuce production. The findings support the integration of green manure systems in vegetable cultivation, particularly for enhancing soil health and crop yields.\n\nOverall, this research contributes valuable insights into the role of specific leguminous species in sustainable agriculture, emphasizing the potential of lablab bean as a superior green manure for lettuce cultivation.

(2019) investigates the solar drying of cowpea beans (Vigna unguiculata) using a heat accumulator dryer to enhance drying efficiency during nighttime. Given Brazil's abundant solar radiation, the research aims to optimize drying processes while maintaining product quality, addressing the limitations of traditional sun drying, particularly the interruption of drying at night.\n\nThe experimental setup involved drying cowpea grains initially at a moisture content of 65.42% (d.b.) through direct solar exposure during the day. At night, half of the samples were transferred to a heat accumulator dryer, while the other half served as a control, left in a laboratory environment. The study employed various mathematical models—Approximation of Diffusion, Page, Verma, Logarithmic, and Two Terms—to analyze drying kinetics, achieving high coefficients of determination (R² > 0.98) and low mean square deviations (MSD < 0.01).\n\nThe effective diffusivity (Def) of the cowpea beans was determined to be approximately 10^-11 m²/s, indicating the rate at which moisture migrates from the interior to the surface of the grains. The heat accumulator dryer maintained an average temperature of 43.0 ± 3.3 °C, significantly higher than the ambient conditions, which facilitated continued moisture loss during nighttime drying. The results demonstrated that the combination of solar drying and the heat accumulator dryer effectively reduced moisture content to 6.73% (d.b.) after the drying process, compared to the control, which absorbed moisture and reached a final content of 10.45% (w.b.).\n\nThe study's findings highlight the efficacy of the heat accumulator dryer as a complementary technology to solar drying, preventing moisture reabsorption and enhancing overall drying efficiency. The mathematical models provided robust predictions of drying kinetics, with the Approximation of Diffusion model being particularly effective for the combined drying method. This research contributes valuable insights into sustainable agricultural practices, emphasizing the potential of solar energy in post-harvest processing and the importance of optimizing drying methods for crop preservation and quality maintenance. \n\nOverall, the integration of renewable energy sources in agricultural drying processes presents a promising avenue for improving food security and reducing reliance on fossil fuels in developing regions.

Conducted in Janaúba, MG, Brazil, the experiment utilized a randomized block design with a split-plot arrangement, assessing five treatments: a control with mineral K2O (40 kg ha^-1) and four TS-3 treatments supplying 20, 40, 60, and 80 kg ha^-1 of K2O, across two cultivars, BRS-MG-Madreperola and Ouro Negro.\n\nResults indicated that the cultivar Ouro Negro exhibited greater responsiveness to TS-3 applications compared to BRS-MG-Madreperola, particularly in terms of leaf, stem, and shoot dry weights (LDW, StDW, ShDW) and their ratios. Notably, the application of 20 kg ha^-1 of K2O via TS-3 resulted in optimal growth, while higher doses (60 and 80 kg ha^-1) negatively impacted grain yield due to increased soil salinity and sodium levels, which are detrimental to common bean crops sensitive to salt stress.\n\nThe study highlights that the interaction between TS-3 doses and cultivars significantly influenced vegetative growth metrics. For instance, at 40 kg ha^-1 of K2O from TS-3, Ouro Negro achieved a LDW of 830.8 kg ha^-1, a 160% increase over the control. Conversely, higher K2O doses led to reduced LDW and leaf-to-shoot ratios, indicating a shift towards stem growth at the expense of leaf development, which is critical for photosynthesis and overall yield.\n\nGrain yield analysis revealed that the cultivar BRS-MG-Madreperola produced a higher yield (approximately 14.5% more) than Ouro Negro, attributed to its ability to allocate more resources to grain production despite lower pod numbers per plant. The study concluded that TS-3 can effectively supply potassium for common bean cultivation, but careful management of application rates is essential to mitigate the adverse effects of salinity on crop yield.\n\nIn summary, the findings underscore the potential of using treated sewage as a nutrient source in common bean production while emphasizing the need for balanced nutrient management to optimize yield and minimize salinity-related stress. The recommended K2O application rate of 20 kg ha^-1 via TS-3 is crucial for maximizing agronomic performance in common bean crops."}

The research highlights the limited adoption of control practices against these nematodes in Brazilian agriculture, despite their potential threat to bean production.\n\nSampling was conducted across ten municipalities, revealing six nematode species: *Helicotylenchus dihystera*, *P. brachyurus*, *Pratylenchus crenatus*, *Meloidogyne javanica*, *Meloidogyne incognita*, and *Rotylenchulus* sp. Notably, *H. dihystera* was ubiquitous and the most abundant species, while *P. brachyurus* was found in 94% of samples in Paraná and 100% in São Paulo. The study established that densities exceeding 6.67 specimens of *P. brachyurus* per cm³ of soil resulted in visible root decay, indicating significant pathogenicity.\n\nThe methodology included nematode extraction via centrifugal-flotation and identification through morphological analysis and α-esterase electrophoresis for *Meloidogyne* species. The glasshouse experiments assessed the impact of varying initial population densities of *P. brachyurus* on two bean cultivars, *Pérola* and *Campeiro*. Results indicated that while high initial densities (1,350 specimens) did not cause measurable damage, lower densities (150 and 450 specimens) led to increased nematode reproduction factors and root damage.\n\nThe findings underscore the low overall nematode densities in the surveyed regions, which may explain the minimal crop losses reported by farmers. However, the authors caution that continuous double-cropping with susceptible hosts could elevate nematode populations, potentially leading to future yield losses. The study emphasizes the need for integrated pest management strategies to mitigate the risks posed by *P. brachyurus* and other nematodes in dry bean cultivation.\n\nIn conclusion, the research provides critical insights into the nematode dynamics affecting dry bean crops in Brazil, highlighting both the current low threat level and the potential for future issues if management practices do not adapt to changing nematode populations. The study advocates for increased awareness and proactive measures among growers to prevent nematode population surges, particularly in light of the significant agricultural role of dry beans in Brazil."}

The research aims to assess the compatibility of these treatments for seed health and subsequent seedling performance.\n\nCommon bean seeds of the cultivar BRS Estilo were artificially inoculated with the Fop isolate IAC 11.299-1. The treatments included chemical fungicides (fludioxonyl, flutriafol, and methyl thiophanate) and biological agents from *Trichoderma* spp. (isolates SF04, GF 422, and strain 1306), both individually and in combination. Laboratory evaluations focused on seed health, germination rates, seedling length, and dry matter, while greenhouse assessments measured emergence speed, percentage of emergence, and pathogen transmission rates from infested substrates.\n\nResults indicated that the combination of methyl thiophanate with biological products was the most effective, achieving a 91-95% reduction in Fop incidence. In contrast, flutriafol alone showed limited efficacy, with only a 9% control rate. Biological agents alone reduced pathogen incidence by 66-68%. Notably, treatments combining chemical and biological fungicides enhanced pathogen control compared to individual applications, suggesting synergistic effects.\n\nThe study also highlighted the protective effects of these treatments on seedling development. For instance, the combination of fludioxonyl with *Trichoderma* isolates improved seedling length and dry matter compared to untreated controls. However, the use of flutriafol and GF 422 negatively impacted germination and seedling quality, indicating potential phytotoxicity.\n\nIn terms of pathogen transmission, the hypocotyl region exhibited higher colonization rates than the root, with treated seeds showing significantly lower Fop incidence in both tissues.

The research focuses on the linear and spatial correlations among soil properties, straw production from palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha), and the grain yield of winter beans following the grass.\n\nKey soil physical attributes assessed included soil bulk density (BD), macroporosity (MA), microporosity (MI), total porosity (TP), penetration resistance (PR), gravimetric water content (GW), and volumetric water content (VW) at two depths (0.0-0.10 m and 0.10-0.20 m). A geostatistical grid with 124 sampling points was established over a 4000 m² area to collect data.\n\nThe study found an inverse linear correlation between the remaining straw from U. brizantha and both bean yield and plant population, indicating that higher straw amounts negatively impacted these parameters. Conversely, common bean yield exhibited a direct linear correlation with gravimetric water content in the 0.10-0.20 m soil layer, suggesting that adequate moisture is crucial for optimizing yield. Spatially, winter bean yield was strongly dependent on the distribution of volumetric water content in the 0-0.10 m layer.\n\nStatistical analysis revealed high variability in grain yield (GY), plant population (PP), and dry matter yield (DMY) of U. brizantha, with coefficients of variation of 22.2%, 20.7%, and 32.6%, respectively. The study also highlighted that soil physical properties showed low variability, likely due to the long-term implementation of no-till practices, which tend to homogenize surface soil layers.\n\nThe results indicate that while the presence of U. brizantha straw can enhance soil quality by improving moisture retention and reducing erosion, excessive straw can hinder bean germination and establishment, leading to lower yields. The study emphasizes the importance of managing straw levels to optimize common bean production in no-till systems, particularly in the context of irrigation practices.\n\nOverall, the findings contribute valuable insights into the interactions between soil management practices and crop productivity, underscoring the need for tailored agronomic strategies to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of common bean cultivation in the Cerrado region.

Conducted during the winter season of 2015 across two locations in Goiás, Brazil, the experiments utilized a randomized block design with a factorial arrangement (5 cover crops × 4 desiccation times × 2 inoculation treatments + 2 controls). The cover crops included millet (Pennisetum americanum), crotalaria (Crotalaria juncea), and two species of Brachiaria (Urochloa brizanta and Urochloa ruziziensis), alongside a fallow treatment.\n\nKey findings indicate that the desiccation timing of cover crops did not significantly affect the common bean's nodulation, growth, or yield. However, the total nitrogen (Total-N) accumulated by cover crops was influenced by sowing times, with millet and crotalaria showing superior dry mass (DM) and Total-N accumulation. Inoculation with rhizobia significantly enhanced the number of nodules (NN), nodule dry weight (NDW), chlorophyll content (CC), and shoot dry weight (SDW) in common bean plants, particularly in the Santo Antônio de Goiás site.\n\nThe study revealed that common bean cultivated after Brachiaria brizanta, Brachiaria ruziziensis, millet, and fallow produced higher grain yields (GY) compared to those grown after crotalaria. Notably, the GY achieved under no-tillage with fallow was comparable to that of the nitrogen control treatment (90 kg N ha^-1), highlighting the potential of using cover crops to replace synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. The findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate cover crops and managing their desiccation to optimize nitrogen availability and enhance the agronomic performance of common beans.\n\nOverall, this research contributes valuable insights into sustainable agricultural practices by demonstrating that effective cover crop management and rhizobial inoculation can significantly improve the productivity of common beans while reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers.

Conducted in Botucatu, Brazil, the research utilized a randomized complete block design with split plots, examining three plant densities (5, 7, and 9 plants m-1) and five N rates (0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 kg ha-1). Key metrics evaluated included aboveground dry matter (DM), leaf nutrient concentrations, yield components, grain yield, and protein concentration in grains.\n\nResults indicated that lower plant densities (5 and 7 plants m-1) enhanced aboveground DM production and the number of pods per plant without compromising grain yield. In the absence of N fertilization, reduced plant density correlated with decreased leaf N concentration. Conversely, N application significantly increased both DM and leaf N concentration, particularly at lower densities. Specifically, grain yield increased linearly with N supply, with IPR 139 and Pérola showing increases of 17.3% and 52.2%, respectively, at the highest N rate (180 kg ha-1).\n\nThe study highlights that lower plant densities promote larger plants with more branches, facilitating greater pod production. The interaction between plant density and N rate significantly influenced leaf nutrient concentrations, with lower densities resulting in higher N accumulation under N application. Notably, N fertilization also enhanced leaf concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Zn, while the concentrations of Fe and Mn were affected by the interaction of plant density and N rate.\n\nFinal plant populations were inversely related to initial densities, with higher initial densities leading to greater reductions in final populations. The cultivar Pérola exhibited a greater response in terms of grain yield and number of pods per plant to N application compared to IPR 139, suggesting that Pérola's growth habit (type II/III) is more responsive to N availability.\n\nThe study concludes that adopting lower plant densities (5 or 7 plants m-1) can enhance DM and pod production without reducing grain yield, while N application is crucial for maximizing yield potential. These findings have implications for optimizing common bean cultivation practices, particularly in terms of disease management and nutrient management strategies in no-till systems.

For common beans, the AMF species Acaulospora scrobiculata, Dentiscutata heterogama, Gigaspora margarita, and Rhizophagus clarus, as well as the joint inoculation treatment, resulted in increases exceeding 200% in shoot dry matter and over 80% in soybean. Notably, mycorrhizal colonization rates reached up to 700% higher than controls without inoculation, particularly with R. clarus and joint inoculation.\n\nThe application of the mycorrhizal stimulant yielded variable effects across AMF species. In beans, A. scrobiculata exhibited the most consistent positive responses, with significant increases in shoot dry matter (61.5%) and nutrient accumulation (Ca, P, Zn) compared to controls. In soybean, the stimulant also enhanced colonization rates and nutrient uptake, particularly with Claroideoglomus etunicatum and R. clarus.\n\nAnalytical methods included dry matter assessment, nutrient quantification via atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and mycorrhizal colonization evaluation through staining techniques. The results underscore the importance of AMF diversity and the potential of mycorrhizal stimulants in enhancing crop performance, particularly in nutrient-poor soils typical of the Brazilian Savannah.\n\nThe study highlights the role of AMF in improving plant resilience against biotic and abiotic stresses, suggesting that the integration of AMF inoculation and stimulant application could be a viable strategy for sustainable agriculture. Future research should focus on optimizing AMF species selection and stimulant application rates to maximize crop yield and nutrient efficiency in various agro-ecosystems."}

Conducted over two growing seasons (2015 and 2015/2016) at Capivara Farm in Goiás, Brazil, the research utilized a randomized block design with four replicates, comparing the control genotype IPR Colibri with three super early genotypes: CNFC 15873, CNFC 15874, and CNFC 15875.\n\nKey findings indicate that biomass accumulation in stems and leaves occurs until flowering, after which the focus shifts to pod development. The study highlights the importance of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) absorption, with genotypes exhibiting higher nutrient uptake correlating with increased grain yield. Specifically, CNFC 15874 demonstrated the highest productivity during the winter season, yielding similarly to IPR Colibri, while CNFC 15873 and CNFC 15875 matched the control in the summer season.\n\nNutrient analysis revealed that the accumulation of N, P, potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) in leaves peaked around 42-49 days after emergence, indicating a critical period for nutrient translocation to reproductive structures. The average growing season for these super early genotypes was notably shorter, at 70 days in winter and 63 days in summer, facilitating the possibility of multiple cropping cycles within a year.\n\nThe study also identified that the CNFC 15874 genotype, despite its high nutrient accumulation, was susceptible to Meloidogyne javanica nematodes, which adversely affected its yield in the summer season. In contrast, IPR Colibri, CNFC 15873, and CNFC 15875 exhibited greater resilience against nematode infestation, maintaining competitive yields.\n\nStatistical analyses, including ANOVA and Pearson correlation, confirmed significant relationships between nutrient accumulation and yield components, emphasizing the role of N and P in enhancing grain yield. The results suggest that the super early genotypes are promising for sustainable agriculture, particularly in regions facing water scarcity, as they allow for efficient resource use and the potential for increased food production.\n\nIn conclusion, the study underscores the potential of super early common bean genotypes to improve agricultural outputs while addressing challenges related to drought and nutrient management, providing a pathway for future breeding and agronomic strategies in common bean cultivation."}

Utilizing the CSM-CROPGRO-Dry bean simulation model, the authors simulated the effects of twelve sowing dates (from March 1 to June 20) on two cultivars: Pérola and BRS Radiante. The findings indicate that early sowing, particularly in March, significantly enhances water use efficiency and yields compared to traditional sowing dates.\n\nThe model simulations revealed that early sowing resulted in greater water savings, with March sowing requiring less irrigation due to favorable rainfall patterns. Specifically, the average irrigation depth required was 232 mm for Pérola and 189 mm for BRS Radiante, with the lowest requirements observed in March (179 mm for Pérola and 136 mm for BRS Radiante). The irrigation water use efficiency (WUE) was notably higher for early sowing, with values reaching 2.39 kg m⁻³ for BRS Radiante, compared to 1.85 kg m⁻³ for Pérola.\n\nYield simulations indicated that Pérola consistently outperformed BRS Radiante across all sowing dates, with average yields of 3,200 kg ha⁻¹ and 2,856 kg ha⁻¹, respectively. Early sowing in March yielded 3,265 kg ha⁻¹ for Pérola and 3,127 kg ha⁻¹ for BRS Radiante, demonstrating that early sowing does not adversely affect Pérola's yield while significantly benefiting BRS Radiante.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of climatic conditions, such as air temperature and solar radiation, on crop performance. The optimal temperature range for common bean development is between 15 ºC and 29 ºC, with lower temperatures negatively impacting seed formation and filling. The authors noted that the correlation between yield and climatic variables was significant, emphasizing the role of environmental factors in determining crop success.\n\nThe research underscores the potential for early sowing as a viable agronomic practice to improve irrigation efficiency and crop yields in common bean production. This approach not only enhances productivity but also contributes to sustainable agricultural practices by optimizing water use in the face of increasing water scarcity. The findings advocate for the adoption of early sowing strategies, particularly with the anticipated release of cultivars resistant to the golden mosaic virus, which could mitigate risks associated with early planting.

The SCS Predileto cultivar exhibited superior competitive traits, evidenced by a greater reduction in leaf area and shoot dry mass of the weed compared to BRS Campeiro and IPR Uirapuru. Specifically, at the highest density of 110 wild poinsettia plants, the weed reduced the leaf area of the bean plants by approximately 32% and their dry mass by 50%. \n\nThe study measured several parameters, including stem diameter, leaf area, chlorophyll content, plant height, and shoot dry mass. Statistical analysis revealed significant interactions between the bean cultivars and wild poinsettia populations for most measured variables, except for chlorophyll content. The wild poinsettia's leaf area increased linearly with plant density, while the bean cultivars showed reduced leaf area and dry mass as weed density increased. Notably, SCS Predileto maintained better growth metrics under competition, suggesting its potential as a more resilient cultivar in weed-infested environments.\n\nThe results underscore the importance of understanding the competitive dynamics between crops and weeds, particularly in the context of developing effective weed management strategies. The findings suggest that selecting bean cultivars with higher competitive abilities, such as SCS Predileto, could mitigate the adverse effects of wild poinsettia competition, potentially reducing reliance on herbicides and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nIn conclusion, this research highlights the differential competitive abilities of black bean cultivars against E. heterophylla, providing insights that could inform breeding programs aimed at enhancing crop resilience and yield in the face of weed competition.

The experimental design employed randomized blocks with a split-plot arrangement, examining three maize cropping systems: maize as a single crop, maize intercropped with Urochloa ruziziensis (brachiaria), and maize intercropped with Crotalaria spectabilis (crotalaria). Five N topdressing doses (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg ha^-1) were applied during the common bean's winter growing season.\n\nResults indicated that the maize cropping systems did not significantly affect maize grain yield. However, the maize/crotalaria intercropping system produced the highest straw mass and N accumulation, attributed to crotalaria's effective biological N fixation and rapid decomposition, enhancing nutrient availability for subsequent crops. The common bean's grain yield and quality attributes were significantly improved when grown after maize/crotalaria intercropping, even without additional N fertilization. Specifically, common bean yields increased linearly with N doses, with the maize/crotalaria system yielding grains comparable to those fertilized with over 200 kg ha^-1 of N.\n\nThe study highlights that the intercropping of maize with crotalaria not only supports sustainable agricultural practices by reducing reliance on mineral fertilizers but also enhances the agronomic performance of subsequent common bean crops. The findings suggest that integrating leguminous cover crops like crotalaria can optimize N dynamics in cropping systems, leading to improved yields and reduced input costs, thus promoting sustainable agriculture. Overall, the maize/crotalaria intercropping system is recommended for common bean cultivation in similar edaphoclimatic conditions, offering both economic and environmental benefits."}

The study utilized six seed lots with varying combinations of high vigor seeds (HVS) and low vigor seeds (LVS), specifically designed to assess how these differences affect germination, seedling emergence, and ultimately, grain yield.\n\nSeed vigor was evaluated through several physiological tests: germination percentage, first count of germination, electrical conductivity, and accelerated aging. The results indicated that seed lots with higher vigor (Lots 1 to 3) maintained germination rates between 79% and 86%, while Lots 5 and 6, composed predominantly of LVS, exhibited lower germination rates of 69% to 71%. The vigor tests further confirmed the classification of seed lots, with electrical conductivity and accelerated aging tests effectively distinguishing between high and low vigor groups.\n\nField trials were conducted in a randomized block design, where the grain yield was measured at harvest. The findings revealed a stark contrast in yield between high vigor and low vigor seed lots, with yields averaging 1,903.2 kg/ha for high vigor lots compared to 1,571.8 kg/ha for low vigor lots, translating to a yield reduction of approximately 20% when using LVS. This reduction underscores the critical role of seed vigor in determining crop performance, as even slight variations in seed quality can significantly influence yield outcomes.\n\nThe study highlights that while traditional germination tests are essential, they may not sufficiently reflect the vigor levels necessary for predicting yield potential. Instead, incorporating vigor assessments such as electrical conductivity and accelerated aging into seed quality control programs is recommended to enhance predictive accuracy regarding crop performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the research emphasizes the importance of selecting high vigor seeds to optimize common bean yields, advocating for improved seed quality assessment methods in breeding and agricultural practices. The findings contribute to the understanding of seed vigor's role in crop establishment and yield, providing valuable insights for breeders and agronomists aiming to enhance common bean production."}

A total of 25 genotypes, including carioca (beige with brown stripes) and black commercial groups, were evaluated for various quality traits, including cooking time (CT), water absorption capacity before (Peanc) and after cooking (Peapc), percentage of whole grains (PWG), total soluble solids in the broth (TSSb), volumetric expansion before (EXPVbc) and after cooking (EXPVac), and dry grain density (DD).\n\nThe results indicate significant genotype × environment interactions affecting technological quality traits. Notably, the rainy season produced the shortest mean cooking time (26.34 minutes), while the winter season exhibited the highest mean water absorption capacity (105.25%). The genotypes C2-1-6-1, C4-8-1-1, LP04-03, IAC-Imperador, P5-4-4-1, and Pr11-6-4-1-2 consistently demonstrated superior cooking times across seasons, outperforming the control cultivar IAC-Alvorada.\n\nThe study highlights the variability in cooking time, which ranged from 21 to 40 minutes depending on the genotype and season. The correlation analysis revealed significant relationships among traits, particularly between Peanc and CT, suggesting that higher water absorption correlates with longer cooking times. However, the phenotypic correlations were not strong enough to support early selection in breeding programs, indicating that environmental factors play a crucial role in trait expression.\n\nAdditionally, the percentage of whole grains after cooking varied significantly, with mean values indicating that over 50% of grains broke during cooking, which is undesirable for consumer preference. The total soluble solids content in the broth was influenced by cooking time and the percentage of whole grains, with the rainy season yielding the lowest TSSb (10.78%).\n\nIn conclusion, the findings underscore the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in breeding programs aimed at improving the technological quality of common beans. The identified genotypes with favorable cooking characteristics may be prioritized for further breeding efforts to enhance consumer acceptance and processing efficiency. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying genetic mechanisms and optimizing growing conditions to consistently produce high-quality beans."}

{"doi": "10.1590_fst.30718", "summary": "This study investigates the granular structure and crystallinity of starches from common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) in both raw and cooked forms, utilizing Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The research highlights the importance of these legumes as significant sources of protein, fiber, and minerals, particularly iron, and emphasizes their starch content, which ranges from 45% to 60%.\n\nSEM analysis revealed distinct morphological characteristics among the starch granules of the evaluated bean varieties. Cowpea and carioca beans exhibited gelatinization upon cooking, characterized by the aggregation of starch granules, while black beans demonstrated resistance to complete gelatinization, indicative of the hard-to-cook (HTC) phenomenon. The study noted that raw cowpea starch granules were kidney-shaped, with surface irregularities and cracks, while black bean starch granules were ellipsoidal and showed minimal surface damage. The gelatinization process was confirmed by the loss of birefringence in cooked samples, suggesting structural changes in the starch granules.\n\nXRD analysis provided insights into the crystallinity of the starches, revealing that the diffraction patterns were more consistent with the classification of standard polyform A, despite the general classification of legume starches as type C. The relative crystallinity (RC) values were significantly different among the varieties, with black beans showing the highest RC (10.64%), followed closely by cowpea (10.57%) and carioca beans (10.50%). The study discusses how the crystallinity is influenced by the size and arrangement of amylopectin chains, which affects the starch's susceptibility to hydrolysis.\n\nThe findings underscore the relevance of starch properties in food science and technology, particularly in relation to cooking quality, nutritional value, and potential industrial applications such as biodegradable plastics. The study suggests that understanding the structural and functional properties of bean starches can inform breeding programs aimed at improving cooking quality and nutritional profiles, as well as optimizing postharvest handling and storage conditions to mitigate the HTC phenomenon.\n\nIn conclusion, this research contributes valuable data on the morphological and crystallinity characteristics of starches from common beans and cowpea, highlighting their implications for food processing and nutritional enhancement. Further studies are warranted to explore the genetic basis of these traits and their impact on consumer acceptance and health benefits."}
{"doi": "10.1590_fst.31321", "summary": "This study investigates the nutritional and functional properties of green-kernel black bean (Vigna cylindrica) flours subjected to various processing methods, including soaking, roasting, cooking, autoclaving, and germination. The research highlights the beans' high nutrient density, particularly in dietary fiber (165.4 g/kg), magnesium (2190 mg/kg), anthocyanins (791.6 mg/kg), and total phenolic content (4.4 g gallic acid equivalent/kg), surpassing values reported for other pulses.\n\nProcessing methods significantly influenced the chemical composition, anti-nutritional factors, antioxidant characteristics, and starch digestibility of the flours. Cooking and autoclaving notably enhanced water holding capacity and flour brightness while effectively reducing anti-nutritional factors such as tannins, saponins, and trypsin inhibitors, thereby improving starch digestibility. Specifically, cooking and autoclaving reduced tannin and saponin levels by approximately 65% and 28%, respectively, and completely inactivated trypsin inhibitors. Conversely, germination resulted in a milder reduction of anti-nutrients while preserving antioxidant compounds and achieving good starch digestibility.\n\nThe antioxidant properties of the flours were assessed through DPPH free radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, revealing that all processing methods diminished anthocyanin content and total phenolic content, with autoclaving causing the most significant losses. Notably, germination increased total phenolic content from 2.35 to 3.56 g GAE/kg, likely due to enzyme activation that hydrolyzed high-molecular-weight phenolic compounds.\n\nPhysical properties such as water and oil holding capacities were also evaluated. Heat treatments (roasting, cooking, and autoclaving) significantly increased water holding capacity, attributed to starch gelatinization and protein denaturation. Color analysis indicated that processing altered the color attributes of the flours, with roasting enhancing the yellow hue, likely due to pigment transformations.\n\nIn conclusion, green-kernel black beans are identified as a valuable source of nutrients and functional components. The study suggests that while cooking and autoclaving effectively reduce anti-nutrients, germination offers a balanced approach by maintaining antioxidant levels. The findings support the potential of green-kernel black bean flour as a nutritious ingredient for developing cereal-based and gluten-free products, addressing the need for increased pulse consumption in Western diets. Further research is warranted to optimize processing conditions for maximizing health benefits while minimizing nutrient losses."}

The research highlights the significance of germination as a low-cost method to enhance the nutritional and functional properties of legumes, which are already recognized for their high protein and complex carbohydrate content.\n\nThe germination process was conducted over ten days under controlled conditions, with samples collected at various intervals for analysis. The TPC and total flavonoid (TF) content were quantified using HPLC and spectrophotometric methods, revealing that both legumes exhibited peak TPC concentrations on days 6 and 7, with values reaching 685.21 mg GAE/100 g dry matter for beans and 910.69 mg GAE/100 g dry matter for peas. Notably, the study found that germination significantly increased TPC by 70.04% for beans and 55.85% for peas compared to non-sprouted seeds.\n\nThe antioxidant capacity was assessed using multiple assays, including DPPH, ORAC, FRAP, and CUPRAC. Results indicated that pea sprouts had superior AOx values (512.64 mg TE/100 g dry matter for DPPH and 6083.55 mg TE/100 g dry matter for ORAC) compared to beans, which showed better performance in FRAP analysis (421.07 mg TE/100 g dry matter). The study also noted that germination led to variations in specific phenolic compounds, with increases in gallic and syringic acids in peas and catechin and quercetin in beans.\n\nThe enzymatic activity of hydrolases and polyphenol oxidases during germination was linked to the modification and polymerization of TPC, which may contribute to the observed changes in antioxidant activity. The study emphasizes that the type of legume and germination conditions significantly influence the biological activity of sprouts.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings suggest that germination enhances the bioactive compound profile and antioxidant properties of legumes, making them valuable ingredients for functional foods. This research underscores the potential of using germination as a strategy to improve the health benefits of legumes, which could play a role in the prevention of chronic diseases. Further exploration of the underlying mechanisms and the effects of different germination conditions is warranted to optimize the health benefits of legume consumption."}
{"doi": "10.1590_S0100-06832007000300010", "summary": "This study investigates the impact of varying soil phosphorus (P) levels on leaf senescence in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) plants, specifically the Carioca cultivar. Conducted in a controlled environment, the experiment utilized eight P treatments ranging from 5 to 640 mg kg^-1, applied to pots containing an Oxic Haplustult soil. The researchers monitored live and senesced leaves weekly, measuring dry matter and P accumulation in senesced leaves over time.\n\nKey findings indicate that the number of live leaves increased until 48 days after emergence (DAE), followed by a decline across all P treatments. However, the rate of leaf production and senescence was significantly influenced by P availability. Higher P levels resulted in a more pronounced increase in leaf number during early growth stages, but also led to a rapid decline in leaf number post-48 DAE. In contrast, lower P levels resulted in a slower increase and decrease in leaf number.\n\nThe accumulation of dry matter and P in senesced leaves was positively correlated with P supply, peaking at different times depending on the P treatment: 48-54 DAE for high P levels, 62-68 DAE for intermediate levels, and 69-76 DAE for low levels. This suggests that while P supply did not affect the timing of maximum leaf number or the onset of senescence, it did influence the timing of peak senescence and nutrient deposition.\n\nThe study also measured P concentrations in senesced leaves, which increased with higher P levels, indicating a reduced proficiency of nutrient resorption as P availability increased. This finding aligns with the concept that enhanced P nutrition may lead to less efficient nutrient translocation to seeds, as evidenced by stable seed P concentrations across treatments despite increased biomass and P accumulation in vegetative tissues.\n\nThe harvest index and P harvest index did not significantly differ among P treatments, suggesting that P nutrition did not alter the efficiency of remobilization of photoassimilates and P from leaves to seeds. This reflects a complex relationship between nutrient availability, leaf senescence, and overall plant productivity.\n\nIn conclusion, while optimal P supply enhances leaf growth and accelerates senescence, it does not alter the fundamental timing of these processes in common bean plants. The study highlights the importance of understanding nutrient dynamics in relation to plant growth stages, particularly in the context of breeding strategies aimed at improving yield and nutrient use efficiency in leguminous crops."}

The study evaluated RCI, aboveground dry matter, total leaf N concentration, yield components, grain yield, relative yield, and N use efficiency.\n\nResults indicated a strong correlation between RCI and leaf N concentration, affirming the chlorophyll meter's utility in determining N requirements. The NSI threshold of 90% was found to be more effective than 95% for indicating the need for N sidedressing, as it allowed for timely interventions that improved N use efficiency while minimizing unnecessary N application. During the rainy season, treatments M3 and M4 demonstrated significant yield increases compared to the control, with M4 achieving higher N use efficiency despite lower total N application.\n\nThe study concluded that monitoring RCI with a chlorophyll meter can effectively guide N sidedressing decisions, enhancing N use efficiency and crop yield.

Conducted from 2005 to 2008 on Hapludalf soil, the research aimed to optimize nutrient application strategies for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and maize (Zea mays), while also assessing the residual effects on subsequent black oat (Avena strigosa) crops.\n\nThe experimental design included twelve treatments with varying rates of PS (10, 20, and 30 m³ ha⁻¹) and TM (1 and 2 t ha⁻¹), both applied alone and with N topdressing, alongside controls of mineral fertilization (NPK) and no fertilization. Results indicated that the combination of PS at 20 and 30 m³ ha⁻¹ with N topdressing significantly enhanced grain yields for both common bean and maize, achieving increases of up to 2441% compared to untreated controls. Notably, the highest grain yields were recorded at 2.31 Mg ha⁻¹ for common bean and 5102 kg ha⁻¹ for maize under optimal treatment conditions.\n\nNitrogen accumulation in plant tissues was identified as a critical factor correlating with grain yield, while apparent nutrient recovery (N, P, K) from organic sources did not consistently correlate with yield outcomes. The study found that PS application led to greater apparent recoveries of N (up to 73%) compared to TM, which exhibited lower recoveries due to its higher organic nitrogen content requiring mineralization.\n\nThe residual effects of the treatments on black oat were less pronounced, with no clear impact from N topdressing on dry matter production. However, PS application demonstrated better residual effects in the first year, while TM showed benefits in subsequent years, likely due to its slower mineralization rate.\n\nAnalytical methods included statistical analysis of variance and nutrient accumulation assessments, revealing that the combined use of organic and mineral fertilizers can enhance nutrient availability and crop productivity. The findings underscore the potential for integrated nutrient management strategies that leverage both organic and industrialized sources to optimize crop yields while minimizing environmental impacts.\n\nIn conclusion, the study highlights the effectiveness of using PS and TM in conjunction with mineral N to improve crop yields in a sustainable manner, while also providing insights into nutrient dynamics and the importance of understanding manure composition for effective fertilization practices."}

Canadian Wonder) under conditions of low phosphorus availability. Conducted on unsterilized sandy clay loam soil, the experiment utilized a randomized block design with nine treatments, including three pre-crops (maize, wheat, and fallow) and three soil management practices (ploughing, mulching, and bare fallow).\n\nKey findings indicate that fallowing and soil disturbance significantly reduced the natural infectivity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Mycorrhizal colonization of bean roots was notably higher in soils previously cropped with maize, which is recognized for its strong mycorrhizal associations, compared to those following wheat or fallow. The study revealed that mycorrhizal infection occurred more rapidly in recently cropped soils than in fallow soils, suggesting that pre-cropping with mycorrhizal hosts enhances the inoculum potential for subsequent crops.\n\nAnalytical methods included spore density assessments using modified differential water-sucrose centrifugation, which demonstrated that spore populations were significantly lower in fallow plots than in those cropped with maize or wheat. Soil management practices also influenced spore density, with mulched plots maintaining higher spore counts compared to ploughed or bare soils, particularly during the winter months when soil temperatures were low.\n\nThe results showed a direct correlation between spore density and mycorrhizal colonization rates in bean plants, with higher spore densities leading to increased mycorrhizal infection percentages. Plant growth metrics indicated that root, stem, and leaf dry weights were significantly greater in bean plants grown in soils previously cropped with maize, while those following fallow exhibited the lowest growth parameters. The study also noted that soil disturbance from ploughing negatively impacted mycorrhizal colonization, aligning with previous findings that minimal tillage practices favor higher levels of mycorrhizal infection.\n\nThis research underscores the importance of pre-cropping and soil management practices in enhancing mycorrhizal colonization and subsequent plant growth in common beans, particularly in phosphorus-deficient soils. The findings have implications for agricultural practices, suggesting that integrating mycorrhizal host crops into rotation systems can improve soil health and crop productivity, particularly in tropical agricultural systems where crop rotation is prevalent. Further studies are warranted to explore the long-term effects of these practices on mycorrhizal populations and crop yields."}

Conducted through six greenhouse experiments, the study systematically varied micronutrient concentrations to assess their impact on crop performance.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n1. **Zinc (Zn):** Application of Zn significantly enhanced the dry matter yield of upland rice, while it negatively affected common bean yields at higher concentrations. Zn application improved nitrogen (N), magnesium (Mg), and copper (Cu) uptake in common beans but decreased phosphorus (P) uptake. In rice, Zn increased Zn concentration but reduced N, calcium (Ca), and Cu uptake, indicating species-specific responses to Zn fertilization.\n\n2. **Manganese (Mn):** Mn application resulted in increased dry matter yields for both corn and common bean. It enhanced the uptake of Mg, Zn, and iron (Fe) in corn while decreasing Ca uptake. In common beans, Mn positively influenced the uptake of potassium (K), Zn, and Mn but had antagonistic effects on P and Cu uptake. This suggests that Mn plays a critical role in nutrient interactions, particularly in acidic soils.\n\n3. **Copper (Cu):** Cu application improved dry matter yields in both rice and common bean, although excessive Cu concentrations led to reduced yields. Cu significantly increased its own concentration in plant tissues, with rice exhibiting higher Cu accumulation than common bean. Cu also had synergistic effects on the uptake of P, K, and Mn in rice, while negatively impacting Ca, Mg, and Fe uptake.\n\n**Analytical Methods:** The study employed various analytical techniques, including atomic absorption spectroscopy for nutrient analysis and colorimetric methods for phosphorus determination. Regression analysis was utilized to evaluate treatment effects, revealing significant interactions between micronutrients and macro/micronutrient uptake.\n\n**Conclusions:** The research underscores the varying requirements and responses of upland rice, common bean, and corn to Zn, Mn, and Cu applications. It highlights the complexity of nutrient interactions in plants, which can be synergistic, antagonistic, or neutral, depending on the crop species and nutrient involved. These findings are particularly relevant for optimizing fertilization strategies in Oxisols, enhancing crop yields, and addressing micronutrient deficiencies in acidic soils.\n\n**Relevance:** This study contributes to the understanding of micronutrient dynamics in crop production, providing insights that can inform breeding programs and agronomic practices aimed at improving nutrient use efficiency and crop resilience in tropical soils."}

(2011), the genetic control of potassium (K) content in common bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris) was investigated, focusing on maternal effects, heritability, and selection gains in early hybrid generations. The research utilized four cultivars from the Mesoamerican gene pool, generating reciprocal F1 and F2 generations, along with backcrossed populations (BCP1 and BCP2). K content was quantified using nitric-perchloric digestion followed by flame photometry, revealing a range of 6.0 to 14.9 g kg^-1 dry matter across progenies.\n\nThe findings indicated no significant maternal effect on K content, with narrow-sense heritability estimates ranging from 33.26% to 43.05%, suggesting a low to intermediate heritability for this trait. Partial dominance was observed for low K content, complicating selection efforts. The study highlighted that environmental factors exert a strong influence on K content, making genetic improvement challenging. Despite the genetic variability observed in the F2 generation, selection for increased K content was not successful, as the local environment significantly impacted this trait.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of understanding the genetic basis of mineral content in common beans, particularly K, which is crucial for human nutrition. The study's results suggest that breeding programs aimed at enhancing K content in common bean seeds may face difficulties due to the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The authors recommend further investigation into advanced generations to better understand the genetic architecture underlying K content and to explore potential breeding strategies for improving nutritional quality in common beans."}

The research aimed to identify lines with high agronomic performance and enhanced nutritional quality, particularly focusing on biofortification strategies to combat mineral deficiencies.\n\nThe authors employed the ¯Z index for the selection of superior lines based on multiple traits, including cycle duration, weight of 100 grains, grain yield, cooking time, and mineral concentrations. Notably, the lines DF 06-09 and DF 06-03 demonstrated high iron concentrations (>0.95 g kg^-1 dry matter) alongside strong agronomic performance, while DF 06-08 and DF 06-23 exhibited high calcium concentrations (>1.4 g kg^-1 dry matter). The selected lines were predominantly semi-early cycle and displayed rapid cooking times, which is advantageous for consumer preference.\n\nThe experimental design included randomized complete blocks with three replicates, and the analysis revealed significant line x year interactions for grain weight, yield, cooking time, and calcium concentration, indicating environmental influences on these traits. The study found that cycles ranged from 72 to 78 days, with most lines yielding between 1,883 to 3,290 kg ha^-1, highlighting their potential for cultivation in varying climatic conditions.\n\nCooking times varied significantly, with all evaluated lines meeting the desirable threshold of less than 30 minutes, thus aligning with consumer expectations for energy efficiency in cooking. The calcium concentrations were classified into three groups: low (<0.7 g kg^-1), intermediate (0.8 to 1.3 g kg^-1), and high (>1.4 g kg^-1), with selected lines exceeding previous reports for cultivated beans. Iron concentrations were similarly stratified, with the identified high-performing lines matching or surpassing levels found in wild accessions.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of the selected common bean lines for biofortification programs aimed at improving dietary calcium and iron intake. The authors recommend further breeding efforts, including hybridizations between lines with complementary mineral profiles, to develop nutritionally complete cultivars.

(2007) investigates the potential of phytoremediation using two leguminous green manure species, *Stizolobium aterrimum* and *Canavalia ensiformis*, to mitigate the effects of soil contamination by the herbicide trifloxysulfuron-sodium on the growth and productivity of common bean (*Phaseolus vulgaris*). The experiment was carried out in Coimbra, MG, Brazil, utilizing a sandy clayey Red-Yellow Argisol over a period from March to November 2003.\n\nThe experimental design involved a 4 x 5 factorial scheme with four levels of trifloxysulfuron-sodium contamination (0.00, 3.75, 7.50, and 15.00 g ha^-1) and five preceding cultivation treatments: (1) *S. aterrimum* with straw removal, (2) *S. aterrimum* with straw retention, (3) *C. ensiformis* with straw removal, (4) *C. ensiformis* with straw retention, and (5) a weed-free control. The leguminous plants were cultivated for 65 days before bean sowing, and their effects were assessed based on plant height, dry mass of the aerial part, and grain productivity at 45 days after emergence.\n\nResults indicated that prior cultivation of either leguminous species significantly enhanced the height and dry mass of bean plants compared to the control, particularly at lower herbicide contamination levels. Notably, *C. ensiformis* was more effective than *S. aterrimum* in promoting bean productivity at the lowest herbicide dose (3.75 g ha^-1). The retention of straw from both leguminous species did not adversely affect bean growth or productivity, suggesting that it does not contribute to recontamination of the soil.\n\nThe study highlights the mechanisms of phytoremediation, including rhizodegradation and phytodegradation, where the leguminous plants may absorb and metabolize the herbicide, thus reducing its bioavailability to subsequent crops. The findings support the feasibility of using these green manures in agricultural systems to remediate herbicide-contaminated soils, allowing for the earlier cultivation of sensitive crops like beans, while also improving soil fertility through the addition of organic matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the research underscores the dual benefits of using *S. aterrimum* and *C. ensiformis* not only for phytoremediation of trifloxysulfuron-sodium but also for enhancing the growth and yield of common beans, thereby contributing to sustainable agricultural practices. Further studies are warranted to explore the long-term effects of such practices on soil health and crop productivity."}

The research aimed to characterize the dynamics of weed communities at two critical growth stages of the bean plants: V3 (first trifoliate leaf) and R8 (grain filling). \n\nThe experimental design utilized randomized blocks with three replications, focusing on eight commercial cultivars categorized into erect and semi-erect/prostrate growth types. The study employed a square inventory method using a 0.25 m² frame to identify and quantify weed species, which were subsequently dried and weighed to assess dry matter.\n\nAt the V3 stage, a total of 1,116 weed specimens were collected, representing 12 species across nine families, with the Poaceae, Amaranthaceae, and Asteraceae being the most prominent. Notably, Sorghum halepense, Brachiaria plantaginea, and Boerhavia diffusa exhibited the highest importance value indexes (IVI). In contrast, at the R8 stage, the total number of specimens decreased to 285, with Amaranthus viridis emerging as the most significant species, indicating a shift in weed community composition as the bean plants matured.\n\nThe study revealed that the more prostrate cultivars had lower IVI values for weeds at the R8 stage, suggesting enhanced competitive ability against weeds due to quicker canopy closure, which limits light availability for weed growth. The results indicated that the growth habit of the bean cultivars significantly influences weed dynamics, with prostrate cultivars demonstrating superior competitive efficiency.\n\nThe research highlights the importance of understanding weed populations in relation to crop growth habits to inform effective weed management strategies. The findings suggest that cultivars with prostrate growth types may offer better resistance to weed competition, which is crucial for optimizing bean production in regions with high weed pressure. The study underscores the need for ongoing research into the interactions between crop growth forms and weed communities to enhance agricultural productivity in the face of weed competition."}

The Asteraceae family was the most represented, followed by Poaceae and Euphorbiaceae. The study revealed a high similarity index (SI) of over 70% among the weed communities in both intercropping and monoculture systems, indicating that the weed flora was largely consistent across different cultivation methods.\n\nThe methodology employed included the square inventory method, where a 0.5 x 0.5 m square was used to sample weeds, followed by quantification of their biomass and leaf area using a LICOR CI-202 leaf area meter. The results indicated that the intercropping system generally resulted in lower weed biomass compared to monocultures, particularly in the first crop year, likely due to the competitive advantage provided by the denser planting of beans.\n\nThe study also highlighted the impact of environmental factors, such as reduced rainfall during the first year, on weed growth and biomass accumulation. The authors noted that the intercropping system, by providing greater soil coverage, could suppress weed proliferation, especially for C4 species like buffelgrass and Indian goosegrass, which thrive under high light conditions.\n\nIn terms of management implications, the findings underscore the importance of understanding weed dynamics in intercropping systems to enhance agricultural sustainability. The identification of key weed species and their ecological behaviors can inform targeted weed management strategies, particularly in regions where castor beans are cultivated alongside common beans.\n\nOverall, this research contributes valuable insights into the ecological interactions between crops and weeds, emphasizing the need for integrated weed management approaches in agroecosystems to optimize crop yields and minimize competition from undesirable plant species."}

The research was performed in a greenhouse setting using a completely randomized design with four replications, where cultivars were treated with varying doses of ethoxysulfuron (0, 50, 100, and 200 g ha^-1).\n\nResults indicated significant variability in the response of the bean cultivars to ethoxysulfuron, with shoot dry matter (SDM) reductions ranging from 30% to 80% at the highest dose. The cultivars identified as more tolerant included IPR 81, IPR Uirapuru, BRS Estilo, IPR Gralha, and BRS Pérola, while those classified as less tolerant were IPR Eldorado, IPR Tuiuiú, IPR Tangará, IPR Curió, UTF 3, UTF 5, and BRS Esplendor. Notably, at the 100 g ha^-1 dose, several cultivars maintained SDM reductions above 80%, indicating a threshold for herbicide tolerance.\n\nThe study utilized the GGE biplot model to analyze the interaction between cultivar performance and herbicide dose, revealing that cultivars with a positive association (angle <90°) with specific doses exhibited better performance under those conditions. Conversely, cultivars with negative associations (angle >90°) demonstrated poorer tolerance across all doses tested.\n\nMechanistically, the authors suggest that tolerance to ethoxysulfuron may involve differential metabolism of the herbicide, with specific enzymes such as P450 mono-oxygenases and Glutathione-S-Transferase playing crucial roles. This aligns with previous findings that indicated metabolic degradation as a primary mechanism of herbicide tolerance in beans.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of understanding cultivar-specific responses to herbicides, which can inform breeding programs aimed at developing more tolerant bean varieties. This research contributes to the limited literature on herbicide tolerance in common bean cultivars, particularly regarding ALS inhibitors, and highlights the potential for improved weed management strategies in bean cultivation.

The research was conducted in a greenhouse setting, employing a completely randomized design with a 2×2×5 factorial scheme, where the factors included the two bean cultivars, two emergence timings of volunteer corn (-7 days and 0 days relative to beans), and five plant proportions (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100).\n\nKey findings indicate that the height, leaf area, and dry biomass of both bean cultivars were significantly affected by the presence of volunteer corn, particularly when it emerged earlier. The cultivar IPR Gralha exhibited greater tolerance to competition compared to Fepagro Triunfo, as evidenced by its relatively higher dry biomass and leaf area under competitive conditions. Specifically, early emergence of volunteer corn reduced the leaf area of both cultivars, while simultaneous emergence only impacted the leaf area of Triunfo. The dry biomass of beans was notably diminished when corn emerged prior to beans, highlighting the competitive advantage of early-emerging volunteer corn.\n\nThe study utilized graphical analysis of relative productivity (RP) and total relative productivity (TRP) to assess competitive interactions. Results showed that the relative height of beans decreased significantly in the presence of volunteer corn, particularly at higher corn proportions. The relative competitiveness indices indicated that when volunteer corn emerged early, it was more competitive than both bean cultivars, emphasizing the importance of planting beans in areas free from volunteer corn.\n\nThe research underscores the critical role of emergence timing in plant competition dynamics and suggests that the use of longer-cycle bean cultivars may enhance competitive ability against volunteer corn.

The beans were subjected to varying doses of gamma radiation (0, 1, 2, 6, and 10 kGy) to assess potential improvements in quality and reduction of post-harvest losses.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n1. **Color Evaluation**: Trained sensory panels assessed color differences using a ranking test under natural daylight conditions. No significant differences in color were observed among irradiated and non-irradiated beans (p < 0.05), indicating that gamma radiation does not adversely affect the visual quality of the beans.\n\n2. **Hydration Time**: The hydration capacity was measured by soaking 10 g of beans in 50 mL of distilled water, with assessments at 30-minute intervals for the first two hours, followed by hourly checks until stabilization. Although no significant differences were found among treatments (p < 0.05), irradiated beans (1, 2, and 10 kGy) absorbed more water than the control, except for the 6 kGy treatment, which matched the control's absorption.\n\n3. **Cooking Time**: Cooking times were significantly reduced for irradiated beans compared to the control, with non-irradiated beans taking an average of 40.34 minutes to cook, while irradiated beans required between 14.00 and 24.17 minutes, depending on the dose. No significant differences were noted among the irradiated treatments (1, 2, 6, and 10 kGy) (p < 0.05).\n\n**Statistical Analysis**: Data were analyzed using Tukey’s test at a 5% significance level, with results processed through SAS software. The study's design included a control group and multiple irradiated treatments to facilitate comparative analysis.\n\n**Implications for Breeding and Storage**: The findings suggest that gamma radiation can effectively reduce cooking times without compromising color quality, which is crucial for consumer acceptance. This method could be beneficial in extending the shelf life of beans and minimizing losses due to spoilage or pest infestation during storage.\n\n**Conclusion**: Gamma irradiation at doses up to 10 kGy does not significantly alter the hydration capacity or color of Carioca Tybatã beans but significantly reduces cooking time compared to non-irradiated beans. This research supports the use of gamma radiation as a viable post-harvest treatment to enhance the quality and marketability of beans.

The research focuses on the centesimal composition, mineral content, tannins, and phytates in raw and cooked beans, utilizing various cooking methods including cooking with and without soaking water.\n\nKey findings indicate that processing significantly influences the nutritional profile of beans, with variations observed across cultivars. Cooking reduced the levels of tannins and phytates, with the most substantial reductions occurring when beans were cooked without soaking water. Specifically, tannin content decreased by 64-83% across cultivars, while phytate levels were also notably diminished, particularly in beans cooked without soaking water. The study highlights that the cooking process increased insoluble dietary fiber while decreasing soluble fiber compared to raw samples.\n\nThe protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) revealed that Pérola had the lowest protein quality, while Talismã exhibited the highest. The protein content varied among cultivars, with raw beans containing between 22.57 g/100 g (Pérola) and 24.42 g/100 g (Talismã). Cooking generally enhanced protein content, although some cultivars showed a decrease when cooked without soaking water.\n\nMineral analysis showed that iron, zinc, calcium, copper, and manganese levels varied significantly among cultivars, with the Black cultivar (Diamante Negro) exhibiting the highest iron content (9.16 mg/100 g) in raw beans. The study also noted that the presence of antinutritional factors like tannins and phytates could hinder mineral bioavailability, necessitating further research into their impact on human nutrition.\n\nThe study utilized various analytical methods, including HPLC for phytate quantification and spectrophotometry for mineral analysis, ensuring robust data collection. The findings underscore the importance of processing methods in enhancing the nutritional value of common beans, suggesting that cooking practices can effectively reduce antinutritional factors while potentially improving nutrient availability.\n\nIn conclusion, this research emphasizes the need for tailored processing techniques to maximize the nutritional benefits of common beans, particularly in regions where they serve as a staple food. The results provide valuable insights for plant breeding and food science, aiming to improve the nutritional quality and consumer acceptance of common beans.

The in vitro protein digestibility of untreated flour was between 47.30% and 56.17%, with significant increases observed post-enzymatic treatment (p < 0.05). Notably, the OPNS cultivar exhibited the highest digestibility (81.6%) after treatment with Bacillus sp. protease, representing a 50% increase from the control. The ON cultivar showed the best results with commercial protease, achieving a 44% increase in digestibility.\n\nMineral analysis indicated that the concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and zinc were consistent with literature values. However, treatment with Bacillus sp. protease resulted in decreased levels of copper and manganese, while iron content increased significantly, with a maximum increase of 102% in TAL flour treated with Bacillus sp. protease. This enhancement in iron availability is attributed to the proteolytic action of the enzyme, which alters protein structures and reduces iron-protein interactions, thus improving bioavailability.\n\nThe study underscores the potential of enzymatic hydrolysis to improve the nutritional quality of common beans, particularly in enhancing protein digestibility and mineral availability.

The research involved two bean genotypes, IPR Uirapuru (black) and IPR Juriti (carioca), subjected to five storage durations (0, 45, 120, 240, and 360 days) and six storage conditions, including various packaging types and environmental settings.\n\nCooking time was measured using the Mattson Cooker, and data were analyzed through ANOVA and regression analysis to explore interactions between factors. The results indicated that genotype had a minimal effect on cooking time compared to storage time and conditions. Specifically, storage time was found to be the most significant factor influencing cooking time, with longer storage periods correlating with increased cooking times. The study highlighted that beans stored in plastic at low temperatures (freezer) exhibited the least increase in cooking time, making this method a practical recommendation for consumers.\n\nThe findings also revealed that beans stored in uncontrolled ambient conditions, particularly in paper packaging, resulted in the longest cooking times after 360 days. This condition was associated with poor gas exchange and unstable temperature and humidity, leading to the hardening of the beans. Conversely, storage in plastic containers at low temperatures effectively preserved the beans' cooking quality, supporting the recommendation for freezer storage to maintain the technological quality of beans over time.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of environmental factors in post-harvest handling of beans, suggesting that proper storage conditions can mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged storage on cooking quality. The authors advocate for further research into controlled atmosphere storage to enhance the preservation of cooking quality in beans.\n\nIn conclusion, while genotype plays a role in cooking time, the study emphasizes that storage time and conditions are paramount. The optimal storage method identified—plastic packaging in the freezer—provides a viable strategy for consumers to enhance the quality and convenience of bean consumption."}

Mill.*), maize, common beans (*Phaseolus vulgaris L.*), wheat, and black oats.\n\nKey findings indicate that the highest adult population peak occurred on wheat on August 3, 2001, coinciding with the flowering period. The dynamics of male and female populations were similar on common beans and soybeans, while females predominated on maize from 30 days after emergence (dae) until approximately 45 dae. Males were more prevalent during the flowering period, suggesting a correlation between reproductive behavior and plant phenology. Notably, the greatest larval population peak was observed on maize roots, affirming maize as a preferential host for *D. speciosa*.\n\nThe introduction of a latter growing season for maize is posited as a significant factor contributing to the increasing populations of *D. speciosa*, as it allows for continuous insect development and extended periods of crop vulnerability. This shift in agricultural practice has resulted in adults being reported throughout the year, contrasting with historical data that indicated population peaks primarily in February and March.\n\nSampling methods included random collection of soil samples for larvae and sweep netting for adults, with larvae separated from soil using a sieve. The study emphasizes the need for integrated pest management strategies, particularly the application of semiochemicals, which have been suggested as effective control measures.

(2014) presents a novel method for determining moisture content in grains using microwave-assisted loss on drying (MALOD), aiming to enhance efficiency compared to the conventional loss on drying (LOD) method, which typically requires 24 hours at 105°C. The MALOD technique significantly reduces analysis time to just 50 minutes while maintaining accuracy, with results aligning closely (94-102% agreement) with the LOD method.\n\nThe research evaluated various parameters including irradiated power, sample mass, container type, and irradiation time across a range of ground grain samples, including white rice, brown rice, peas, various beans (white, carioca, black), chickpeas, lentils, and corn. It was found that using sample masses between 2g and 15g did not yield significant differences in moisture content for LOD, but MALOD exhibited issues such as hot spots and sample carbonization at masses exceeding 2g. Consequently, a sample mass of 2g was selected for MALOD to avoid these complications.\n\nThe study also compared different containers for moisture determination, concluding that polypropylene flasks were preferable over glass weighing filters due to their hydrophobic nature, which eliminated the need for preconditioning and reduced overall processing time. The MALOD method demonstrated a low variability in results (relative standard deviation < 2.3%), indicating its precision is comparable to LOD.\n\nIn terms of energy consumption, MALOD and infrared loss on drying (IRLOD) methods were found to be more efficient than LOD, which consumes significant energy over prolonged periods.

The research utilized two statistical methodologies: Maximum Yield Deviations (MYD) and Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction Analysis (AMMI), to assess genotype-environment interactions (GEI) and identify the most stable and productive cultivars.\n\nThe experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications, where the cultivars included standard carioca types ('IAC-Carioca', 'IAC-Carioca Eté') and black types ('FT-Nobre', 'IAC-Una'). The analysis revealed significant GEI, indicating that the performance of cultivars varied across different seasons, locations, and years. The MYD method identified 'MA-733327' and 'LP 9637' as the most stable and productive across all seasons, while 'FT-Nobre' and 'LP 9637' excelled specifically in the dry season. The AMMI analysis corroborated these findings, with biplots indicating that 'MA-733327' and 'LP 9637' were also among the top performers in terms of stability and responsiveness to environmental improvements.\n\nThe study highlighted that the rainy season yielded the highest productivity (2,496 kg ha^-1), while the dry season was the least productive (2,263 kg ha^-1), attributed to high temperatures affecting flowering and pod formation. The results from both MYD and AMMI methods were largely congruent, although MYD consistently associated stability with higher yield, while AMMI provided a more nuanced understanding of the environmental context.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of selecting cultivars based on their adaptability to specific environments, which is crucial for breeding programs aimed at improving common bean productivity in Brazil. The study contributes to the understanding of GEI in common beans and offers practical recommendations for cultivar selection in diverse agricultural settings. The methodologies applied can serve as valuable tools for breeders seeking to enhance the stability and yield of common bean cultivars in response to environmental variability."}

(2007) investigates the applicability of the Meyer and Schilz function for the non-destructive estimation of moisture content in common bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), specifically the Campeão-3 variety, using radiofrequency dielectric measurements. The research aims to enhance the accuracy of moisture content assessment, which is crucial for the efficient operation of automated grain drying systems.\n\nThe methodology involved measuring the dielectric properties of bean seeds at moisture contents ranging from 11.5% to 20.6% (wet basis) and bulk densities between 756 and 854 kg/m³. The dielectric parameters, relative permittivity (ε') and dielectric loss factor (ε''), were obtained using a 4285A HP Meter across frequencies from 75 kHz to 30 MHz. The study found that the Meyer and Schilz function, expressed as [(ε' – 1)/ε''], could estimate moisture content with a standard error of 0.5 to 1.0 percentage points, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.\n\nKey findings include the establishment of a density-independent relationship for the Meyer and Schilz function within specific moisture ranges. The function was shown to be unique for moisture levels of 11.5% to 16.0% at 5 MHz and 16.0% to 20.6% at 85 kHz, although it was not fully density-independent across all tested conditions. The study also highlighted that the sensitivity of the function to moisture content decreased at higher moisture levels, complicating its application for continuous monitoring in drying processes.\n\nMultiple regression analyses yielded equations that improved moisture estimation accuracy, with coefficients of determination (r²) reaching up to 0.90. The study concluded that while the Meyer and Schilz function provides a viable method for estimating moisture content, its limitations in achieving full density independence and the need for frequency adjustments based on moisture levels pose challenges for its implementation in automated drying systems.\n\nOverall, this research contributes valuable insights into the dielectric properties of common bean seeds and their potential for improving moisture measurement techniques, which are critical for optimizing grain drying operations and ensuring product quality. Further exploration of the dielectric behavior of other grain types and the development of more robust models could enhance the utility of this approach in agricultural practices."}

Conducted over two cropping seasons (2010/11 and 2011/12) in Papanduva, SC, Brazil, the research utilized a randomized block design with four replications, evaluating genotypes including BRS Campeiro, CHP 01-238, CHP 01-239, and others.\n\nKey findings indicate that grain yield losses due to weed interference ranged from 30.8% to 54.9%, with a positive correlation between yield reduction and dry biomass produced by weeds. Notably, the average grain yield without weed interference was 3,676 kg ha^-1, demonstrating high yield potential across genotypes. However, the study found no significant variation in plant height or dry biomass of stems and leaves among genotypes, suggesting that these traits do not reliably predict competitive ability against weeds.\n\nSoil coverage by common bean plants was assessed at multiple growth stages (6, 14, 18, 25, and 32 days after emergence), revealing that BRS Campeiro and CHP 01-239 exhibited superior soil coverage at early stages, which is crucial for reducing light availability to weeds. Despite these observations, the correlation between soil coverage and competitive ability was inconsistent across seasons, indicating that environmental factors may influence these traits.\n\nThe research highlights that the competitive ability of black common bean genotypes is more closely related to their ability to suppress weed growth rather than merely tolerating their presence. Genotypes with lower yield losses tended to exhibit greater suppression of weed biomass, reinforcing the importance of selecting genotypes that can effectively compete with weeds.\n\nStatistical analyses, including ANOVA and correlation assessments, were performed using the Sisvar software, revealing that while some genotypes showed promising traits for weed suppression, no consistent morphological characteristics were identified that could predict competitive ability across different environments.\n\nIn conclusion, this study underscores the complexity of weed competition in black common beans and suggests that breeding efforts should focus on enhancing traits that improve weed suppression rather than solely relying on morphological characteristics. The findings provide valuable insights for developing strategies to mitigate weed interference in common bean cultivation, which is critical for improving yield and sustainability in Brazilian agriculture."}

IPR Uirapuru) in a distrophic Red-Yellow Latosol (Oxisol). Conducted in a greenhouse setting, the experiment utilized four levels of P (0, 0.436, 0.872, and 1.745 dag kg^-1) from three sources: partially acidulated phosphate rock (PAP), single superphosphate (SSP), and triple superphosphate (TSP).\n\nKey findings indicate that the addition of P through alkaline biosolid significantly increased extractable phosphorus (Mehlich-1) in the soil, as well as phosphorus accumulation in the plants, grain yield, and total dry mass production. The optimal P level for enhancing these parameters was identified at 0.436 dag kg^-1 from both PAP and SSP, which resulted in the highest agronomic effectiveness index (AEI).\n\nThe study highlights the importance of biosolid application as a sustainable agricultural practice, addressing the environmental challenge of sewage sludge disposal while improving soil fertility. The alkaline biosolid, enriched with nutrients such as calcium and magnesium, not only corrected soil acidity but also facilitated P availability. The results corroborate previous research indicating that alkaline biosolids can enhance soil chemical properties and nutrient uptake in crops.\n\nAnalytical methods employed included Mehlich-1 extraction for soil P analysis and gravimetric methods for determining total dry mass and grain yield. The statistical analysis revealed significant interactions between the level and source of P added, with the highest productivity observed at moderate P levels, suggesting a quadratic relationship between P application and plant growth metrics.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of using alkaline sewage sludge as a dual-purpose amendment—improving soil fertility while providing a viable solution for waste management. This research contributes to the understanding of nutrient dynamics in Oxisols and offers insights for optimizing P fertilization strategies in common bean cultivation, particularly in regions with similar soil characteristics.

(1999) investigates the genetic control of resistance to common bacterial blight (CBB), caused by *Xanthomonas axonopodis* pv. *phaseoli*, in five cultivars of *Phaseolus vulgaris* L. This research is critical due to the significant yield losses associated with CBB and the limited effectiveness of chemical control measures. The authors aimed to elucidate the genetic basis of resistance to inform breeding strategies.\n\nUsing a full diallel cross design, the researchers evaluated three susceptible snap bean cultivars (Alessa, Hab 52, and Hab 198) and two resistant dry bean cultivars (Bac-6 and A-794). The study employed a rigorous methodology that included inoculation with a highly pathogenic isolate (CNF 15) and assessment of disease reaction in leaves and pods using a standardized scale and lesion size measurements, respectively.\n\nThe analysis revealed significant genetic variability among the genotypes for both leaf and pod reactions to CBB, with general combining ability (GCA) showing significant effects for both traits, indicating the presence of additive genetic effects. Specifically, Bac-6 and A-794 exhibited superior resistance, with negative GCA values suggesting their potential as parents for breeding programs aimed at enhancing CBB resistance. In contrast, Alessa, Hab 52, and Hab 198 had positive GCA values, indicating their inferior contributions to resistance.\n\nThe study also highlighted the predominance of nonadditive effects for pod reactions, as evidenced by significant specific combining ability (SCA) effects. Notably, the hybrids Alessa x Bac-6, Alessa x A-794, and Hab 52 x Bac-6 emerged as the most promising combinations for pod resistance. The findings suggest that while resistance in leaves may be fixed through additive genetic effects, pod resistance is influenced more by dominance and epistatic interactions.\n\nThe results underscore the importance of selecting appropriate parental lines based on their combining abilities to develop new cultivars with enhanced resistance to CBB. The study contributes valuable insights into the genetic architecture of CBB resistance in beans, paving the way for targeted breeding strategies that consider both disease resistance and agronomic traits. Future research should focus on the identification of specific genes and molecular markers associated with CBB resistance to facilitate marker-assisted selection in breeding programs."}

The research addresses the critical need for effective disease management strategies in bean cultivation, particularly for smallholder farmers who often lack access to chemical controls.\n\nThe authors utilized an F2 population of 214 individuals derived from a cross between the resistant cultivar Ouro Negro and the susceptible cultivar US Pinto 111. The plants were inoculated with a mixture of eight races of U. appendiculatus to evaluate disease resistance. Segregation analysis indicated that the resistance is governed by a major dominant gene, suggesting a monogenic inheritance pattern.\n\nUsing bulked segregant analysis combined with RAPD techniques, the researchers screened 1,280 decamer primers to identify markers associated with the resistance gene block. They successfully identified two RAPD markers, OX11630 and OF101,050, located at genetic distances of 5.8 ± 1.6 cM and 7.7 ± 1.7 cM from the resistance gene, respectively. The markers demonstrated high reproducibility and were confirmed to flank the resistance gene block, facilitating indirect selection for resistant plants in breeding programs.\n\nThe study reported an impressive indirect selection efficiency (ISE) of 100% when both markers were used simultaneously, underscoring their utility in breeding programs aimed at developing rust-resistant bean cultivars. The findings align with previous research that identified RAPD markers linked to other rust resistance genes, highlighting the potential for pyramiding multiple resistance genes to enhance durability against the pathogen's variability.\n\nThis research contributes significantly to the field of plant breeding by providing molecular tools that can expedite the development of resistant cultivars, thereby improving crop resilience and yield stability in the face of disease pressures. The identified markers are currently being integrated into the breeding program at the Federal University of Viçosa, demonstrating their practical application in enhancing common bean resistance to rust disease.

The authors tested different concentrations of sucrose, phosphorus (P), myo-inositol, abscisic acid (ABA), glutamine, and methionine over varying culture periods (0, 3, 6, and 9 days). The results indicate that phytate accumulation is significantly influenced by the presence of myo-inositol and P, with the highest levels observed under specific concentrations of these compounds.\n\nPhytate serves as a major storage form of phosphorus in seeds, constituting 65-85% of total seed phosphorus. Its accumulation is critical due to its role in mineral chelation, which can lead to antinutritional effects in non-ruminants and humans. The study highlights that the addition of myo-inositol and P not only enhances phytate levels but also correlates with increased seed dry matter accumulation. The authors noted that the accumulation of P varied less than that of phytate across treatments, suggesting a more complex regulation of phytate synthesis.\n\nThe experimental design employed a complete randomized block with four replicates, and the analysis of phytate, total phosphorus, and protein content was conducted using colorimetric methods following acid digestion. The findings revealed that the optimal treatment for phytate accumulation involved 10 mM myo-inositol, 12 mM phosphorus, 160 mM sucrose, and 0.125 mM ABA, leading to a significant increase in phytate content compared to control conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the study discusses the role of D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase (MIPS) in regulating phytate synthesis, suggesting that the expression of this enzyme may be influenced by the tested compounds. The authors propose that future research should focus on elucidating the regulatory mechanisms governing phytate synthesis, including the expression of MIPS and the impact of different growth conditions on seed storage proteins.\n\nOverall, this research provides valuable insights into the biochemical pathways involved in phytate accumulation in common beans, with implications for improving nutritional quality and bioavailability of minerals in legume-based diets. The ability to manipulate phytate levels through in vitro culture conditions could aid in breeding programs aimed at developing bean varieties with enhanced nutritional profiles."}

Conducted on a Haplohumox soil, the research aimed to determine the effectiveness of different fertilization methods and their influence on crop performance, particularly in relation to phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) availability.\n\nKey findings indicate that soybean yields were unaffected by P and K fertilization, attributed to the high soil nutrient levels, while corn and common bean yields significantly benefited from the application of nitrogen (N), P, and K. Specifically, the study found that for crops in a no-tillage system with high P and medium K levels, fertilizer could be applied through various methods without impacting yields negatively. The presence of K in the furrow did not enhance yields, suggesting that K application may not be necessary in this context.\n\nThe experimental design included randomized block trials with treatments varying in nutrient application methods (furrow vs. surface) and types of fertilizers (natural phosphate vs. triple superphosphate). Results showed that corn yields were consistently higher across all years with fertilization, while common bean yields improved significantly in three out of four evaluated seasons. The study also noted that the thousand grain mass (TGM) for corn was positively influenced by fertilization, reinforcing the importance of nutrient management in maximizing crop productivity.\n\nStatistical analyses revealed no significant differences in yield outcomes between the different furrowing devices (double disk vs. coulter), indicating that the method of application may be flexible under the right soil nutrient conditions. The findings support the notion that in regions with adequate soil fertility, particularly high P and medium K, the timing and method of fertilizer application can be adapted without compromising crop yields.\n\nOverall, this research underscores the potential for optimizing fertilizer strategies in no-tillage systems, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices by minimizing input costs and labor while maintaining high productivity levels. The results are particularly relevant for agronomists and farmers seeking to enhance crop yields through effective nutrient management in similar soil and climatic conditions."}

The research aimed to quantify the total dry matter (DM) production and nutrient accumulation, focusing on variations among cultivars with distinct growth habits and commercial classifications.\n\nThe experiment revealed significant differences in nutrient uptake and DM accumulation, particularly during the early vegetative stages (V4 with six and eight three-leaflet leaves). Notably, TAA Gol exhibited superior nutrient accumulation compared to the other cultivars at these stages. In the reproductive stage R7, TAA Dama demonstrated the highest DM and nutrient accumulation, but from R8 onwards, no significant differences were observed among the cultivars.\n\nThe study employed a randomized complete block design, with nutrient accumulation assessed through laboratory analyses of dried plant samples. The results indicated that while nutrient export was generally similar across cultivars, TAA Dama translocated a lower percentage of nutrients to the grain. Specifically, the mean grain yield across all cultivars was 2,782 kg ha^-1, with TAA Dama yielding 2,748 kg ha^-1, indicating competitive performance despite its lower nutrient translocation efficiency.\n\nThe research highlighted that nutrient uptake patterns varied significantly among cultivars, particularly in the vegetative phase, where TAA Gol consistently outperformed others in nutrient accumulation. The findings suggest that early maturing cultivars like TAA Gol may have distinct nutritional demands that differ from those of medium and late-cycle cultivars. This underscores the necessity for tailored fertilization strategies that consider the specific growth habits and nutrient requirements of each cultivar.\n\nIn terms of macro- and micronutrient accumulation, the study found that TAA Gol accumulated higher levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S) during the early stages compared to TAA Dama and IPR Tuiuiú. However, in the R7 stage, TAA Dama led in the accumulation of these nutrients, reflecting its indeterminate growth habit and higher vegetative growth potential.\n\nThe research concludes that while nutrient uptake is similar at the end of the growth cycle across different cultivars, the timing and efficiency of nutrient export vary, emphasizing the importance of understanding these dynamics for effective fertilization management in common bean cultivation. The study contributes valuable insights into the nutritional demands of modern common bean cultivars, which is crucial for optimizing breeding programs and improving agronomic practices."}

The multiplicative index facilitated the selection of superior genotypes, notably red (Amendoim comprido and Light Red Kidney), cranberry ('BRS Executivo' and 'Hooter'), and carioca ('IPR Siriri') types, which exhibited high concentrations of P and Fe. Additionally, Amendoim comprido was distinguished for its elevated K levels.\n\nK was identified as the most abundant macromineral, while Fe was the predominant micromineral across all genotypes and seasons. The study found that K concentrations ranged from 10.13 g kg⁻¹ in 'BRS Esteio' to 15.00 g kg⁻¹ in 'BRS Radiante', with several genotypes classified as high K (>12.00 g kg⁻¹).

The primary aim was to assess variability in DM accumulation and identify optimal harvest timing, given the significance of these traits for enhancing grain yield.\n\nThe research utilized a randomized complete block design with five replicates, evaluating traits such as the number of days to flowering, grain DM, and yield. A quadratic regression model was employed to estimate the days to maximum DM accumulation, revealing low variability among the lines, which discourages selection for this trait. The ideal harvest time was determined to be when 100% of the grains exhibited the characteristic stripes of carioca beans, although this can vary within and among pods. Early harvesting before physiological maturity resulted in an average DM loss of 2.75% per day.\n\nThe study's findings indicate that the average duration for grain filling was 43 days, shorter than previously reported durations, suggesting that to significantly increase yields, lines should ideally have a grain-filling period at least ten days longer than observed. The results also highlighted that the highest average DM accumulation rates varied by sowing season, with the July sowing yielding the best results.\n\nStatistical analyses showed significant differences in grain yield and DM accumulation across lines and seasons, with the highest yields consistently observed in the 'CXII-15' and 'Pérola' lines.

The research involved controlled hybridizations between the cultivars Pérola and Guapo Brilhante, as well as TPS Nobre and Guapo Brilhante, producing reciprocal F1, F2, and backcross generations.\n\nThe phosphorus content in the seeds of the tested progenies ranged from 3.38 to 5.78 g kg^-1 dry matter (DM), with a significant increase of 19.17% observed in certain F2 plants compared to the Guapo Brilhante parent. Notably, no significant maternal effects were detected, indicating that the phosphorus content is predominantly determined by the cotyledons, which account for over 96% of the phosphorus in the seeds. This finding contrasts with previous studies that reported maternal effects on other mineral contents, such as calcium and iron.\n\nHeritability estimates revealed broad-sense heritability values of 82.69% for the Pérola x Guapo Brilhante hybrid and 59.46% for the TPS Nobre x Guapo Brilhante hybrid, while narrow-sense heritability was intermediate at 65.54% and low at 21.37%, respectively.

The lines included carioca, black, and other color patterns, revealing significant genetic variability in nutrient content both among groups and within individual lines.\n\nThe analysis employed the Kjeldahl method for protein quantification and nitroperchloric digestion followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy and UV spectrophotometry for mineral content assessment. Results indicated that black bean lines exhibited the highest average protein (26.08%), iron, and zinc levels, while carioca beans were notable for manganese and magnesium content. Other colored beans showed elevated calcium levels. Positive correlations among most nutrients were observed, suggesting potential for selecting lines with enhanced nutritional profiles.\n\nHeritability estimates for nutrient traits were high (above 94%), indicating a strong likelihood of success in breeding programs aimed at improving nutritional quality. The study also highlighted that the majority of nutrients are likely concentrated in the seed coat, particularly in black beans, which may be attributed to higher tannin content affecting mineral bioavailability.\n\nStatistical analyses, including variance analysis and selection indices, were utilized to identify superior lines based on nutrient composition. Notably, lines CI-128, Safira, and RP-1 emerged as top candidates for breeding due to their high nutrient levels and low coefficient of variation, indicating consistent quality.\n\nThis research underscores the importance of genetic diversity in common beans and its implications for breeding programs focused on enhancing nutritional value, particularly in regions where beans are a staple food source. The findings contribute to the understanding of how seed color correlates with nutrient content, providing a basis for future breeding strategies aimed at improving the nutritional quality of common beans, which are vital for addressing mineral deficiencies in human diets."}

BRS Esteio was bred through a systematic selection process initiated in 1992, involving multiple generations (F2 to F7) and extensive field trials across various Brazilian states. The cultivar exhibits a normal growth cycle of approximately 90 days and demonstrates an average yield of 2,529 kg ha^-1, which is 8.1% higher than control cultivars, with a potential yield of up to 4,702 kg ha^-1 under optimal conditions.\n\nBRS Esteio's breeding involved crossing the lines FT85-113 and POT 51, followed by rigorous selection for disease resistance, particularly against anthracnose (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum), rust, and bacterial blight. The cultivar shows moderate resistance to anthracnose and rust, while being susceptible to angular leaf spot and bacterial blight. Its upright growth habit enhances mechanical harvesting efficiency, making it suitable for direct harvesting.\n\nThe agronomic performance of BRS Esteio was evaluated through 77 trials conducted from 2005 to 2010, across diverse environmental conditions in Brazil. The cultivar's yield was consistently superior in various regions, particularly in the rainy and dry seasons of southern Brazil, where it outperformed controls by significant margins. The average cooking time for BRS Esteio is 29 minutes, and it has a protein content of 20.3%, slightly lower than that of some controls.\n\nBRS Esteio's grain characteristics include a 100-grain weight of 24 g, comparable to other black bean cultivars, and a regular grain color and size. Its resistance profile includes strong resistance to bean common mosaic virus, further enhancing its appeal for cultivation.\n\nThe release of BRS Esteio is significant for Brazilian agriculture, addressing the increasing demand for black beans, which constitute about 20% of the country's common bean production.

The research aims to enhance consumer acceptance of beans by improving these sensory attributes, which have been largely neglected in breeding programs.\n\nA trained sensory panel evaluated nine flavor and texture attributes, including total flavor, beany, earthy, starchy, sweet, bitter, seed-coat perception, and cotyledon texture. Significant variations in these attributes were observed both within and across the 20 Andean seed types, with broad-sense heritability estimates ranging from 0.14 to 0.39. Total flavor intensity and seed-coat perception exhibited the highest heritability (0.38 and 0.39, respectively), while earthy and vegetative intensities had the lowest (0.14 and 0.15). Principal component analysis revealed that starchy and sweet flavors were positively correlated and predominantly found in white bean genotypes.\n\nThe GWAS identified several significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with sensory attributes: six SNPs for total flavor intensity across three chromosomes, five for beany intensity across four chromosomes, three for earthy intensity across two chromosomes, and additional SNPs for starchy, bitter, seed-coat perception, and cotyledon texture. Notably, the SNPs identified for sensory traits were not consistent across different locations, underscoring the influence of environmental factors on trait expression.\n\nThe study also evaluated cooking time and its relationship with sensory attributes, finding that faster-cooking genotypes tended to have higher starchy and sweet intensities but were less beany and bitter. This suggests that cooking time can be optimized without compromising sensory quality.\n\nThe findings provide a foundation for integrating flavor and texture traits into dry bean breeding programs, highlighting the potential for targeted breeding strategies to enhance consumer appeal. The identification of SNPs linked to sensory attributes offers valuable genetic markers for future breeding efforts aimed at improving the sensory profile of dry beans, thereby increasing their marketability and consumption. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of the genetic basis of sensory traits in dry beans and sets the stage for further exploration of consumer preferences and the development of new bean varieties."}

(2013) investigates the geographical distribution and host associations of Rhyssomatus subtilis, commonly known as the black soybean weevil, in northwestern Argentina. This species has emerged as a significant pest of soybean (Glycine max) and, notably, was observed for the first time infesting dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) crops. The research spans from 2009 to 2012, during which 42 localities across Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Tucumán provinces were monitored, covering an area of approximately 541,000 hectares.\n\nR. subtilis was first detected in 2006 in La Fragua, Santiago del Estero, and has since expanded its range significantly, with records indicating movement of about 87 km north, 136 km south, and 99 km west by 2012. The weevil primarily damages soybean and dry bean crops through feeding and oviposition, particularly during the vegetative and reproductive stages. The study highlights that the larvae feed on seeds within the pods, leading to significant crop losses and facilitating the entry of phytopathogens, which further degrade seed quality.\n\nSampling methods included georeferencing localities and employing a vertical beat sheet to collect adult weevils and assess immature stages by examining damaged pods. The findings revealed that R. subtilis was present in 30 localities, with notable concentrations in southern Salta, northwestern Santiago del Estero, and northeastern Tucumán. Additionally, the weevil was found feeding on several non-host weeds, including Conyza bonariensis, Brassica campestris, and Sphaeralcea bonariensis, although these plants do not support oviposition or larval development.\n\nThe authors emphasize the importance of understanding the pest's life cycle and damage potential to develop effective management strategies. The reliance on chemical insecticides for control is highlighted, but the authors caution that high populations can lead to total crop loss, necessitating reseeding. The study underscores the need for preventive measures to mitigate the spread of R. subtilis, particularly given its potential to thrive in new areas due to anthropogenic factors such as the movement of agricultural machinery.\n\nIn summary, this research provides critical insights into the distribution and impact of Rhyssomatus subtilis on soybean and dry bean crops in northwestern Argentina, marking a significant contribution to pest management strategies in the region. The findings call for further investigation into the pest's biology and the development of integrated pest management approaches to safeguard these vital agricultural resources."}

The research addresses the growing concerns regarding the use of chemical insecticides, highlighting the need for sustainable pest management alternatives.\n\nThe experimental design involved applying varying concentrations of *T. harzianum* (3.3 × 10^6, 6.6 × 10^6, and 2.1 × 10^7 spores/kg) and DE (200, 400, and 800 ppm) both individually and in combination. Mortality rates of adult beetles were assessed at intervals of 1, 2, 4, and 7 days post-treatment. The highest mortality rate (93.88%) was recorded after 7 days with the combination of 800 ppm DE and 2.1 × 10^7 spores/kg of *T. harzianum*, which also effectively suppressed the emergence of the second generation of beetles over a 60-day period.\n\nThe study found that while *T. harzianum* alone resulted in a maximum mortality of 57.32% at its highest concentration, the combination treatments significantly enhanced beetle mortality compared to individual applications. Progeny production was notably reduced in treatments combining DE and *T. harzianum*, with the most effective combinations yielding up to 99.38% reduction in progeny emergence.\n\nIn terms of grain damage and weight loss, the untreated beans exhibited 85.22% damage, while the best-performing treatments reduced damage to as low as 2.28% and weight loss to 1.00%. This indicates that the combined application of *T. harzianum* and DE not only controls beetle populations effectively but also preserves the quality of the stored beans.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of integrating biological control agents like *T. harzianum* with inert materials such as DE as a viable strategy for managing *A. obtectus* in stored beans. This approach aligns with integrated pest management (IPM) principles, promoting environmentally friendly practices while mitigating the risks associated with chemical insecticides. The study contributes novel insights into the synergistic effects of fungal and inert dust treatments, suggesting further exploration of *T. harzianum* against other stored-product pests under varying environmental conditions."}

The study specifically examines the host suitability of different cultivars of faba bean (Vicia faba), pea (Pisum sativum), narrow-leaved lupine (Lupinus angustifolius), yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus), white lupine (Lupinus albus), and common vetch (Vicia sativa) for M. hapla.\n\nThe experimental design involved planting legume seeds in soil naturally infected with M. hapla, with initial nematode densities set at 50 second-stage juveniles (J2) per 200 cm³ of soil. The researchers assessed nematode population density changes (Pf/Pi), root galls, egg masses, and eggs per egg mass after the growing season. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and Tukey’s test, were employed to evaluate differences in nematode populations among the different legume cultivars.\n\nResults indicated that faba bean cultivars (Bobas, Amulet, Albus) were particularly conducive to M. hapla development, exhibiting significant increases in nematode population density, with Pf/Pi values exceeding 10, categorizing them as good hosts. Conversely, the narrow-leaved lupine (Karo, Zeus), yellow lupine (Parys, Lord), and white lupine (Boros) demonstrated a reduction in nematode populations, classifying them as poor hosts (Pf/Pi < 1). Notably, the study found that the pea cv. Lasso and common vetch cv. Ina also supported nematode development but to a lesser extent than faba beans.\n\nThe study highlights the potential of using certain legume crops, particularly lupines, in crop rotation strategies to mitigate M. hapla populations in agricultural systems. The authors suggest that legumes with poor host suitability could be integrated into crop management practices to reduce nematode damage, thereby enhancing sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nThe findings contribute to the understanding of host-nematode interactions and provide valuable insights for developing integrated pest management strategies in legume cultivation. Future research directions could include exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying host resistance and the potential for breeding nematode-resistant legume cultivars."}

(2023) investigate the phosphorus (P) acquisition strategies of 11 legume crops under low and optimal P conditions, particularly in acidic soils prevalent in southwest China. Despite high total soil P levels, bioavailability is often limited due to insoluble complexes with iron and aluminum. The research aims to elucidate how different legume species adapt to low P availability through root morphology, organic acid exudation, acid phosphatase activity, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization.\n\nThe pot experiment included soybean (Glycine max), faba bean (Vicia faba), pea (Pisum sativum), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), lentil (Lens culinaris), adzuki bean (Vigna umbellata), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), grass pea (Lathyrus sativus), red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and common vetch (Vicia sativa). Results indicated that P deficiency significantly reduced biomass and P accumulation, with root length and surface area decreasing by 10.5% and 7.9%, respectively. Conversely, organic acid exudation increased by 80.2%, and acid phosphatase activity rose by 16.8%. Notably, root diameter and AMF colonization rates remained unaffected by P levels.\n\nPrincipal component analysis revealed a positive correlation between organic acid exudation and acid phosphatase activity, while root length and surface area negatively correlated with these traits and AMF colonization. P accumulation was positively correlated with root length, surface area, and diameter but negatively correlated with organic acid exudation and acid phosphatase activity. The findings suggest that legume crops employ a P-mobilization strategy involving organic acid exudation and acid phosphatase activity to enhance P acquisition under low soil P conditions.\n\nThe study highlights the trade-offs between root morphological traits and P-mobilization strategies, indicating that legume species exhibit diverse adaptations to low P stress. For instance, faba beans demonstrated superior root traits and P accumulation, while lentils relied more on acid phosphatase activity and AMF colonization. The authors emphasize the importance of root plasticity and the role of root exudates in enhancing P availability, suggesting that these traits are critical for improving legume crop productivity in P-deficient environments.\n\nOverall, this research contributes to understanding the genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying P acquisition in legumes, providing insights that could inform breeding strategies aimed at enhancing P efficiency and crop resilience in challenging soil conditions.

The research highlights the underexplored potential of Tepary beans, which are adapted to arid conditions and possess promising nutritional qualities.\n\n**Nutritional Composition**: Tepary beans exhibited a moisture content of 7.41%, significantly different from the common beans, which ranged from 4.9% to 10.04%. The ash content was 4.96%, differing from Pinto Americano (5.72%) but not from Black Jamapa (4.87%). Protein content was 20.50%, comparable to Pinto Americano (19.13%) but lower than Black Jamapa (23.95%). The lipid content was similar across all varieties, while dietary fiber was significantly lower in Tepary beans (16.15%) compared to common beans (19.01% to 20.01%). Total carbohydrates were 49.46%, not significantly different from Pinto Americano (50.53%) but higher than Black Jamapa (37.72%).\n\n**Cooking Properties**: Cooking times for Tepary beans ranged from 55.1 to 80.49 minutes, with significant differences observed based on soaking duration. Soaking reduced cooking times significantly, with the lowest time recorded for Black Jamapa. The study indicates that soaking enhances the cooking quality by facilitating starch gelatinization.\n\n**Textural Properties**: Texture profile analysis revealed that soaking Tepary beans for 8 hours significantly reduced hardness (from 354.79 N to 98.87 N), chewiness (from 18.62 kg to 2.24 kg), and adhesiveness (from 0.98 kg/s to 0.15 kg). Comparatively, Tepary beans showed similar textural properties to Pinto Americano but differed in adhesiveness.\n\n**Technological Properties**: Hydration capacity and index were significantly lower in Tepary beans (0.11 g/seed and 0.54, respectively) compared to Pinto Americano (0.37 g/seed and 0.97) and Black Jamapa (0.21 g/seed and 0.98). Swelling capacity and index also indicated superior hydration properties in Tepary beans (0.76 ml/g and 3.66) compared to the other varieties. Water absorption capacity (3.09 g/g) and oil absorption capacity (1.13 g/g) were higher in Tepary beans, suggesting better functional properties for food applications.\n\n**Starch Composition**: Tepary beans contained lower resistant starch (0.19%) compared to Pinto Americano (0.27%) and Black Jamapa (0.35%). However, non-resistant starch levels were similar between Tepary and Black Jamapa (4.46% vs. 4.63%), indicating a potential for slower glucose release and a reduced glycemic response.\n\nIn conclusion, Tepary beans possess nutritional and technological properties comparable to common beans, suggesting their potential for increased consumption and cultivation in arid regions.

The research aimed to optimize drying processes to enhance the storage life of green beans, which are prone to spoilage due to their high moisture content.\n\nThe drying kinetics were modeled using nine established thin-layer drying models, with the Midilli et al. model demonstrating the best fit for the experimental data, indicated by high R² values and low reduced chi-square (χ²) and root mean square error (RMSE) values. The effective moisture diffusivity (Deff) was calculated to range from 1.387 × 10⁻⁸ to 3.724 × 10⁻⁸ m²/s, showing a direct correlation with microwave power; higher power resulted in increased diffusivity due to enhanced temperature and vapor pressure within the samples. The activation energy required for the drying process was determined to be 19.185 kW/kg, calculated using a modified Arrhenius equation.\n\nRehydration ratios were assessed post-drying, revealing that samples dried at 800 W exhibited the highest rehydration capacity, attributed to reduced structural damage during the shorter drying time. Colorimetric analysis indicated significant changes in color parameters: brightness (L*), greenness (a*), and yellowness (b*). Specifically, L* values decreased with increasing microwave power, while a* values increased, indicating a loss of green color, particularly at lower powers due to prolonged drying times.\n\nThe findings underscore the efficiency of microwave drying as a method that not only reduces drying time and energy consumption but also preserves the quality of green beans. This research contributes valuable insights into the optimization of drying techniques for agricultural products, with implications for food processing industries aiming to enhance product shelf life and nutritional quality. The study highlights the potential for microwave drying to be integrated into commercial practices, addressing the challenges of moisture management in food preservation."}

The research highlights the potential of germination as a strategy to enhance the nutritional profile and processing characteristics of common beans, which are significant sources of protein and bioactive compounds in human diets.\n\nThe authors report that germination increases the tryptophan (Trp) content from 6.1 mg·g–1 in raw common beans (RCB) to 7.9 mg·g–1 in germinated common beans (GCB), while also improving the levels of sulphur amino acids (methionine and cysteine). In RCB, Trp and sulphur amino acids were limiting, whereas in GCB, only sulphur amino acids remained limiting, indicating a notable enhancement in the amino acid profile due to germination. This improvement is attributed to the activation of metabolic pathways, including the shikimate pathway, which facilitates the de novo synthesis of aromatic amino acids.\n\nThe study also assesses the flavonoid content, revealing that germination significantly increases levels of quercetin and kaempferol, while enabling the synthesis of daidzein and genistein, compounds associated with various health benefits. The total phenolic content remained stable during germination, but the DPPH radical scavenging capacity decreased by 40%, suggesting a complex interplay between germination and antioxidant activity, potentially due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) dynamics during the germination process.\n\nExtrusion processing of both RCB and GCB was performed, with GCB exhibiting a higher expansion index (1.91) compared to RCB (1.51). This increase is attributed to the structural changes in starch and proteins during germination, which enhance interactions during extrusion, leading to improved functional properties of the extrudates.\n\nAnalytical methods employed included high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for flavonoid quantification and spectrophotometric assays for total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. The results indicate that germination not only enhances the nutritional value of common beans but also improves their processing characteristics, making them more suitable for diverse industrial applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings suggest that germination of common bean seeds can significantly enhance their nutritional and nutraceutical value, potentially contributing to improved dietary protein sources and health benefits. Further research is warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes and to explore the implications for plant breeding and food processing strategies aimed at maximizing the health benefits of legumes."}

Jagusia, particularly under abiotic stress conditions. The experiment was conducted in a controlled environment from July to September 2016-2017, utilizing a randomized complete block design with three treatments: EM, T, and a control group.\n\nKey findings indicate that both preparations significantly influenced the content of photosynthetic pigments, with Tytanit® resulting in the highest levels of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids. Specifically, chlorophyll a reached 2.001 mg/g in EM-treated plants, while Tytanit® enhanced pigment content during pod formation, likely due to increased assimilate demand. However, the application of Tytanit® and EM did not lead to significant improvements in yield parameters, such as the number of pods per plant or pod mass, which remained lower than in the control group.\n\nBiochemical analyses revealed that Tytanit® treatment resulted in elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline, suggesting an induction of oxidative stress. In contrast, EM maintained lower proline levels, indicating its potential role in mitigating stress responses. The study also assessed nutrient content in the pods, finding that both treatments significantly reduced the concentrations of essential macroelements (Ca, Mg, P) and microelements (Fe, Mn) compared to the control, raising concerns about the nutritional quality of the harvested beans.\n\nAnalytical methods employed included spectrophotometric assays for pigment quantification and atomic absorption spectrometry for nutrient analysis. Statistical analyses (ANOVA) confirmed significant effects of treatment and measurement time on pigment and stress indicator levels, with the timing of measurements contributing significantly to the observed variations.\n\nThe results suggest that while Tytanit® and EM can enhance certain physiological traits, their application may not be suitable for improving yield or nutrient content in the Jagusia variety of common bean. This study highlights the complexity of plant responses to growth stimulators and underscores the need for further research to optimize their use in agricultural practices, particularly in the context of climate change and abiotic stress management. Future investigations should focus on the dose-response relationships and the potential varietal specificity of these treatments to better inform breeding and cultivation strategies."}

Conducted over two years in a Mediterranean climate, the research utilized a lysimeter experiment with an additive design, comparing sole crops (SC) and intercrops (IC) of two field bean and four barley cultivars.\n\nThe results demonstrated that barley/field bean intercropping significantly enhanced forage DM yield, achieving 14 t/ha, which was 100% and 40% higher than barley and field bean sole crops, respectively. The land equivalent ratios (LER) for DM and N yield were 1.65 and 1.67, indicating a substantial advantage of the intercrop. However, both species experienced competition, particularly for N resources, with barley exhibiting greater competitive ability. The competitive balance index (Cb) suggested that barley was more competitive for N than for other resources.\n\nNitrate leaching was notably lower in the intercrop (34 kg/ha) compared to sole crops, attributed to higher plant density and root competition dynamics. The study found that field bean SC resulted in the highest NO3-N leaching, followed by the intercrop and barley SC. The residual effects on the subsequent ryegrass crop (Lolium multiflorum Lam. westerwoldicum) were also assessed, revealing that ryegrass yields were highest after field bean SC, but the N content was significantly affected by the preceding crop, with field bean providing the most benefits.\n\nThe study highlights that intercropping barley and field bean can effectively reduce land requirements, N leaching losses, and fertilizer inputs, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices. The findings underscore the importance of cultivar selection in optimizing interspecific competition and resource use efficiency. Overall, barley/field bean intercropping presents a viable strategy for enhancing forage quality and sustainability in temperate agroecosystems."}

The study was executed in a greenhouse setting in Bogotá, Colombia, during 2017-2018, utilizing a hybridization technique involving emasculation for both direct and reciprocal crosses. Notably, the efficiency of viable interspecific crosses improved significantly, achieving 67% in F1 populations and backcrosses.\n\nThe research identified two promising interspecific populations, Bacata × ASC 160 and Bacata × ASC 162, which serve as foundational lines for a breeding program aimed at enhancing resistance to black node disease while maintaining commercial grain characteristics. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate parental lines, with Bacata and Simijaca showing greater compatibility with the resistant ASC genotypes.\n\nThe results indicate that the use of P. polyanthus as a female parent mitigates the reversal to P. vulgaris traits, thereby increasing the likelihood of retaining resistance traits in subsequent generations. The study also notes that the efficiency of crosses varied significantly, with direct crosses yielding higher seed production than reciprocal crosses, aligning with previous findings on interspecific hybridization challenges.\n\nThe findings contribute valuable insights into the genetic compatibility of P. vulgaris and P. polyanthus, suggesting that interspecific hybridization can be a viable strategy for enhancing disease resistance in common beans.

The review synthesizes literature from various databases up to December 2022, highlighting the significance of these biological inputs in sustainable agriculture, particularly in the context of climate change and nutrient scarcity.\n\nThe review identifies co-inoculation of rhizobia with other PGPR as the predominant technique, with notable species such as Rhizobium tropici, Rhizobium etli, and the CIAT 899 strain being highlighted for their efficacy in drought conditions. The CIAT 899 strain is particularly noted for its utility in Brazil, while Colombia has limited commercial options, with only one registered product based on Rhizobium phaseoli, lacking evaluation under drought stress.\n\nThe review emphasizes the role of PGPR in promoting plant growth through mechanisms such as biological nitrogen fixation, root architecture modification, and phytohormone production. HS are recognized for their biostimulant properties, enhancing root proliferation and nutrient absorption, thereby improving plant resilience to abiotic stress. The combined application of PGPR and HS is shown to significantly enhance drought tolerance, evidenced by increased nitrogen fixation, seed yield, and overall plant biomass.\n\nThe authors report that 51% of the studies reviewed utilized co-inoculation techniques, yielding improvements in nodulation, chlorophyll stability, and reduced pod abortion rates under drought conditions. The review also notes that HS application led to significant increases in root length, nodule number, and nutrient content, although only 7% of the studies focused on HS.\n\nDespite the promising findings, the review highlights a gap in research within Colombia, where studies on the joint application of PGPR and HS are scarce. The authors advocate for further investigation into native rhizobia strains and their interactions with local bean varieties to enhance agricultural productivity in the Colombian dry Caribbean.\n\nIn conclusion, the review underscores the potential of integrating PGPR and HS as sustainable practices to mitigate the adverse effects of drought on common bean production.

Yield characteristics, including average pod weight, number of pods per plant, total pod weight, dry seed weight, and 100-seed weight, were also enhanced with increasing MAP concentration.\n\nThe study further assessed leaf photosynthetic pigments, revealing increases in total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, which are vital for photosynthetic efficiency. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, specifically the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and the performance index (PI), indicated improved photosynthetic performance under MAP treatment. Additionally, leaf nutrient analysis showed elevated levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), suggesting enhanced nutrient uptake and assimilation.\n\nThe results underscore the potential of foliar MAP application as a practical agronomic strategy to enhance common bean performance under saline conditions, contributing to improved growth, yield, and nutritional quality. This research holds significant implications for breeding programs aimed at developing salt-tolerant bean varieties, ultimately supporting agricultural sustainability in saline-prone regions. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and long-term effects of MAP application on plant stress responses and nutrient dynamics."}
{"doi": "10.18257_raccefyn.274", "summary": "This study investigates the phytoliths produced by three economically and culturally significant crops in Boyacá, Colombia: common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), achira (Canna indica L.), and squash (Cucurbita ficifolia Bouché). Phytoliths, silica structures formed in plant tissues, serve as valuable indicators for understanding plant taxonomy, ecology, and historical agricultural practices.\n\nUsing a standardized dry ashing method for phytolith extraction, the research identified distinct phytolith morphotypes across the studied species. In squash, phytoliths were observed in leaves and fruit epidermis, characterized by scalloped and trichome forms. Achira produced globular phytoliths with circular ornamentation, classified under the Globulolita morpho-tribe. Common bean exhibited elongated phytoliths with hooked ends, belonging to the Capilusita morpho-tribe. Notably, leaves were found to contain the highest concentration of phytoliths, corroborating findings from previous studies.\n\nThe study emphasizes the taxonomic specificity of phytolith morphology, which can provide insights into plant responses to environmental conditions and their evolutionary adaptations. Factors influencing phytolith production include genetic predisposition, plant age, and environmental conditions such as soil composition and moisture availability. The findings suggest that phytoliths may play roles in physical support and defense against herbivory, particularly in the context of Cucurbita species, where silica deposition in fruit tissues could deter pests.\n\nThe research contributes to the understanding of ancient agricultural practices in the Andean region, highlighting the potential of phytolith analysis in paleoethnobotany. However, it also notes limitations in using phytoliths for reconstructing prehistoric diets, as the parts of plants consumed (fruits and rhizomes) typically produce fewer phytoliths compared to leaves. This suggests that alternative methods, such as starch grain analysis, may be more effective for dietary reconstructions.\n\nOverall, this study enhances the knowledge of phytolith diversity in Andean crops and underscores the importance of these structures in both ecological and archaeological contexts. The findings may inform future research on crop domestication, environmental adaptations, and the historical significance of these crops in pre-Hispanic and contemporary societies in Colombia."}

Conducted over three growing seasons at the Federal University of Lavras, the research utilized a randomized complete block design with three bean cultivars (Carioca Pérola, Black IPR Tuiuiu, and Red VR20) and multiple herbicide treatments, including fomesafen and combinations of imazamox and bentazon.\n\nThe experimental design involved main plots for bean cultivars and subplots for herbicide treatments, including hand weeding and various rates of fomesafen, imazamox, and bentazon. The study assessed weed presence, phytotoxicity symptoms, and grain yield, with data analyzed using variance analysis and the Scott-Knott test at a 5% significance level.\n\nKey findings indicate that the combination of imazamox, bentazon, and fomesafen at specified rates (0.23 + 0.6 + 125 g ha^-1) provided the most effective weed control, comparable to hand weeding, and resulted in higher grain yields across cultivars. Notably, the efficacy of herbicides varied significantly across growing seasons, highlighting the influence of environmental conditions and weed community dynamics on herbicide performance.\n\nPhytotoxicity assessments revealed no significant adverse effects on the bean cultivars from the herbicide treatments, suggesting that the mixtures are safe for use in common bean cultivation. The study also noted that while some herbicides effectively controlled specific weed species, their efficacy could be compromised by high weed infestation levels, particularly with species like Bidens pilosa and Commelina benghalensis.\n\nThe results underscore the importance of herbicide mixtures in managing weed resistance and improving crop yields. The findings are particularly relevant for Brazilian farmers, as they provide insights into effective weed management strategies that can enhance common bean productivity while minimizing phytotoxicity risks.

The research involved a comprehensive analysis of seed lots harvested in 2005 and 2006, assessing parameters such as moisture content, germination percentage, seedling vigor, and pathogen infestation.\n\nThe mean moisture content across all seed lots was 8.4%, with no significant variation among them. The analysis classified four lots as high vigor, one as intermediate, and three as low vigor. Notably, the first germination count and electrical conductivity tests emerged as the most effective indicators of seed physiological quality. The study found that all seed lots were infested with fungi, predominantly Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Fusarium species, which are known to adversely affect seed viability.\n\nThe experimental design was completely randomized with four replications, and various tests were conducted, including germination tests under controlled temperature conditions, seedling emergence assessments, and phytosanitary evaluations using hypochlorite and blotter tests. The results indicated that lots R1, R3, and R7 exhibited the highest germination rates (98-99%), while lots R4, R5, and R6 fell below the minimum standard of 80% germination, with R6 showing a particularly low rate of 9%. Electrical conductivity measurements correlated with seed vigor, identifying R1 and R3 as high vigor lots and R5 and R6 as low vigor.\n\nPathogen analysis revealed significant contamination across all lots, with Fusarium spp. being the most prevalent. The findings suggest that poor storage conditions and lack of seed treatment contribute to the deterioration of seed quality, emphasizing the need for improved post-harvest management practices. The study highlights the importance of maintaining seed moisture below 12% and controlling storage environments to mitigate fungal growth and enhance seed viability.\n\nIn conclusion, the research underscores the critical role of seed quality in agricultural productivity, particularly for smallholder farmers who predominantly use saved seeds.

The research highlights the potential of these legumes as nutritious food sources, particularly in regions where legume consumption is low.\n\nThe germination process involved soaking the seeds, followed by a controlled germination period at 16-18 °C. The final products were dried flakes of germinated legumes. Nutritional analyses revealed significant increases in energy, carbohydrates, protein, and fiber content in both germinated red lentil and black bean flakes. Specifically, germinated red lentil flakes exhibited a 9.7% increase in energy value, a 13.1% increase in carbohydrates, and a 10.1% increase in protein. Similarly, germinated black bean flakes showed an 11.7% increase in energy, a 34.1% increase in fiber, and a 12% increase in protein. Notably, the methionine content, an essential amino acid often limited in legumes, increased by 14.4% in black beans.\n\nThe study also assessed the presence of antinutritional factors, such as phytic acid, which can hinder mineral bioavailability. While the phytic acid content did not significantly decrease in red lentils, it increased slightly in black beans post-germination. The antioxidant activity, measured using DPPH and FRAP assays, decreased significantly in both products, likely due to thermal stress during processing.\n\nSensory evaluations conducted by trained and untrained panels indicated a preference for the germinated red lentil flakes over black bean flakes, with higher scores for attributes such as taste and crispness. The sensory characteristics were attributed to the drying process, which enhanced the texture of the products.\n\nOverall, the findings suggest that germination enhances the nutritional profile of red lentils and black beans, making them more digestible and potentially more appealing to consumers. The study underscores the viability of germinated legumes as gluten-free alternatives in diets, contributing to increased legume consumption and addressing nutritional deficiencies in populations with low legume intake. Future research could explore the mechanistic pathways involved in the observed nutritional changes and the potential for scaling up production of these germinated products for broader market applications."}

The breeding line was derived from a program aimed at incorporating the dominant By-2 gene, initially transferred from the scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus), into the ‘Ruddy’ cultivar. The methodology employed a backcrossing approach, utilizing ‘Ruddy’ as the recurrent parent and B-21, a black bean line, as the donor of the By-2 gene.\n\nThe CU-R89 line was evaluated for its resistance to BYMV, characterized by symptoms such as yellow mosaic, leaf malformation, and stunting in susceptible plants. The breeding process involved mechanical inoculation with BYMV at the primary leaf stage across multiple backcross generations, culminating in the identification of homozygous genotypes in BC-4F4. The line was confirmed to retain the By-2 gene, which is crucial for resistance, particularly under elevated temperatures above 30°C, where infected plants may develop systemic necrosis.\n\nMorphologically, CU-R89 is described as a bushy, multiple-stemmed plant with a determinate growth habit, reaching heights of 40 to 50 cm and maturing in 85 to 95 days. It produces pale lavender to rose-purple flowers and fibrous, indehiscent pods containing four to eight seeds. The seeds are kidney-shaped, with a 100-seed weight ranging from 47 to 55 g, and exhibit excellent color retention and cooking qualities similar to ‘Ruddy’.\n\nField trials conducted in northern New York revealed that CU-R89's seed yield was not significantly different from that of ‘Ruddy’, indicating its potential as a viable replacement for the susceptible cultivar. However, CU-R89 remains susceptible to other diseases, including halo blight (Pseudomonas phaseolicola) and common blight (Xanthomonas phaseoli), as well as certain strains of anthracnose (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum).\n\nThe availability of CU-R89 is limited, with small quantities of seed accessible for further breeding programs, particularly in regions where BYMV is prevalent. This breeding line represents a significant advancement in the development of disease-resistant cultivars within the red kidney bean market class, contributing to enhanced resilience in bean production systems.\n\nIn summary, CU-R89 exemplifies a successful integration of viral resistance traits into a commercially relevant bean cultivar, providing a foundation for future breeding efforts aimed at improving disease resistance and overall crop performance in Phaseolus vulgaris."}

The breeding line was created through a backcrossing method involving the resistant cultivar ‘Great Northern-1140’ (GN-1140) and the black-seeded cultivar ‘Midnight’. The resistance is conferred by a single recessive gene, designated as cyv, which was previously identified in GN-1140 and later in ‘Kentwood’. \n\nThe breeding program aimed to incorporate the cyv allele into ‘Midnight’ through a systematic backcross and selfing approach, which allowed for the identification of resistant progeny. Specifically, a black-seeded F3 individual carrying the cyv gene was selected as the male donor parent, while ‘Midnight’ served as the recurrent female parent for five backcross generations. The methodology employed eight pollen parents in each backcross generation to enhance the likelihood of recovering heterozygous individuals, achieving over 99% probability of success. Ultimately, a BC4-F3 line exhibiting homozygous resistance (cyv/cyv) was confirmed through mechanical inoculation.\n\nCU-M90 is characterized by its upright growth habit, reaching heights of 40 to 60 cm, and features stiff stems with 12 to 16 mainstem nodes. The plant produces purple flowers and pods that average 7 to 9 cm in length, containing five to seven seeds. The seeds are dull black, with a 100-seed weight ranging from 22 to 25 g. CU-M90 flowers approximately 33 to 36 days post-emergence and matures in 98 to 107 days, depending on environmental conditions. Notably, CU-M90 demonstrates some tolerance to damping-off and root rot diseases but is susceptible to white mold.\n\nIn addition to its resistance to CYVV, CU-M90 shows resistance to strains U.S. 1 and NY 15 of bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), although it remains susceptible to other BCMV pathotypes and BYMV. The breeding line is considered nearly isogenic to ‘Midnight’, making it a valuable candidate for further evaluation and potential release as a CYVV-resistant cultivar.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of genetic resistance in breeding programs aimed at enhancing crop resilience against viral pathogens, particularly in regions where CYVV poses a significant threat to bean production. CU-M90's development represents a strategic advancement in the breeding of black dry beans, with implications for improving yield stability and food security in affected areas. Seed samples of CU-M90 are available for further research and breeding applications."}

This cultivar was derived through pedigree selection from the F5 breeding lines GN-WM2-79-12 and GN-SK-80-45, which themselves originate from crosses involving various resistant and high-yielding parent lines, including ‘Tacaragua’ and ‘GN Emerson’.\n\n‘Starlight’ exhibits an indeterminate semi-upright growth habit (Type IIb), which enhances its architectural resistance to white mold disease (WMD) caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Field trials indicated that ‘Starlight’ had a significantly lower incidence of WMD compared to other cultivars in certain years, demonstrating its potential for disease avoidance. Yield assessments showed that ‘Starlight’ outperformed standard cultivars such as ‘Harris’ and ‘Spinel’ in WMD test nurseries, while yielding comparably to ‘Beryl’ and ‘UI59’ in non-disease conditions.\n\nThe cultivar is resistant to Uromyces appendiculatus var. appendiculatus, the pathogen responsible for rust, and exhibits moderate susceptibility to common bacterial blight (Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli) and bean common mosaic virus (BCMV). Notably, ‘Starlight’ showed low seed transmission rates of BCMV, indicating a favorable trait for disease management.\n\nIn terms of seed characteristics, ‘Starlight’ has a heavier seed weight and superior seedcoat whiteness compared to other cultivars, as confirmed by sensory evaluations. The uniformity of seedcoat whiteness, which is critical for market acceptance, was rated highest among tested cultivars. However, there were no significant differences in seedcoat cracking or cooking time when compared to other cultivars.\n\nThe development of ‘Starlight’ is significant for plant breeding as it combines desirable agronomic traits such as disease resistance, improved yield potential, and enhanced seed quality. The pedigree and selection process highlights the importance of utilizing diverse genetic backgrounds to achieve these traits. The cultivar’s architectural features and disease resistance mechanisms could serve as a model for future breeding efforts aimed at improving resilience to biotic stresses in dry beans.\n\nFoundation seed for ‘Starlight’ is available through the Nebraska Foundation Seed Division, facilitating its adoption by growers in the region.

{"doi": "10.21273_HORTSCI.29.10.1178", "summary": "In this study, Mark J. Bassett investigates the genetic basis of the griseoalbus (gri) seedcoat color in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), proposing that it is controlled by a newly identified allele, designated pgri, at the P locus. The research involved crossing genetic stocks with distinct seedcoat colors: gri BC2 5-593 (gray-white seedcoat) and p BC2 5-593 (pure-white seedcoat). The recurrent parent, 5-593, is characterized by bishops-violet flowers and small shiny black seeds.\n\nThe F1 progeny exhibited the gri seedcoat color but with reduced intensity, leading to the hypothesis of allelic interaction between gri and p. This hypothesis was confirmed in the F2 generation, which showed no segregation for the bishops-violet flower color, indicating that gri and p are allelic. The dominance hierarchy was established as P > pgri > p, with pgri being partially dominant to p but recessive to P.\n\nThe study utilized a backcross method to develop genetic stocks with single recessive genes for seedcoat color, allowing for the isolation of the gri allele. The results demonstrated that the gri allele has pleiotropic effects, influencing both seedcoat and flower color patterns. Specifically, the flowers of the gri BC2 5-593 line displayed a unique pattern with nearly white wing petals and bishops-violet dots, a phenotype that was consistent across allelism tests with Lamprecht’s gri gene from line V0059.\n\nStatistical analysis of the F2 generation revealed a 3:1 segregation ratio for flower color, supporting the hypothesis of allelism and the proposed dominance series. The findings suggest that the griseoalbus phenotype results from the interaction of the pgri allele with the dominant P allele, leading to gray-white seedcoats and distinct flower patterns.\n\nThe implications of this research extend to plant breeding, particularly in the context of snap bean cultivars. Historically, breeders favored the p allele for its ability to produce pure-white seedcoats, which resulted in undesirable side effects on plant performance. The study suggests that alternative recessive alleles, such as pgri, could provide a viable option for breeders seeking to minimize these deleterious effects while maintaining desirable seedcoat characteristics.\n\nOverall, this research contributes to the understanding of seedcoat color genetics in common beans and highlights the potential for utilizing alternative alleles in breeding programs to enhance both aesthetic and agronomic traits. Further investigations are warranted to explore the biochemical mechanisms underlying the interactions at the P locus and the broader implications for bean cultivar development."}
{"doi": "10.21273_HORTSCI.29.6.709", "summary": "The research article by Stavely et al. (1994) presents the development and characterization of nine rust-resistant navy dry bean germplasm lines, designated BelMiDak-RR-1 through -9, derived from the USDA plant introduction PI 181996. These lines exhibit homozygosity for resistance against all 65 known races of the bean rust pathogen, Uromyces appendiculatus var. appendiculatus, a significant threat to dry bean production in the United States.\n\nThe BelMiDak lines maintain the small white seed phenotype typical of navy beans and possess a type II growth habit, characterized by an erect, narrow profile conducive to improved yield and harvest efficiency. The breeding strategy involved pedigree and backcross methods, aiming to combine comprehensive rust resistance with desirable agronomic traits such as early maturity and resistance to bean common mosaic virus (BCMV).\n\nA key finding is the identification of the Up-2 gene, which confers additional rust resistance and is present in BelMiDak-RR-1, -2, -8, and -9. This gene was transferred from the snap bean cultivar ‘Early Gallatin’ and is associated with a hypersensitive necrotic response to specific rust races. The presence of Up-2 in conjunction with PI 181996 resistance enhances the plant's ability to limit rust infections, resulting in only faint chlorotic reactions rather than the development of uredinia.\n\nMolecular analysis using PCR-RAPD with primer OA141100 confirmed the presence of the Up-2 gene in select BelMiDak lines, facilitating the selection process for this trait in breeding programs. The study also highlights the lines' agronomic performance, with plant heights exceeding those of existing cultivars like ‘Norstar’ and ‘Mayflower’, and seed weights ranging from 17.0 to 23.8 g/100 seeds.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of these germplasm lines in breeding programs aimed at enhancing disease resistance in navy beans, particularly in regions prone to rust epidemics. The incorporation of multiple resistance genes, including the I gene for BCMV resistance, positions the BelMiDak lines as valuable resources for improving the resilience and productivity of dry bean cultivars.\n\nIn conclusion, the BelMiDak-RR germplasm lines represent a significant advancement in the genetic resistance of navy dry beans to rust, providing a foundation for future breeding efforts focused on disease resistance, yield improvement, and adaptation to changing agricultural conditions. The findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of Uromyces appendiculatus on bean production and enhance food security."}

Conducted over two years (1991 and 1993) on a Bernow fine-loamy soil in Oklahoma, the research aimed to optimize dry bean production through various agronomic practices.\n\nThe experimental design included factorial combinations of three bed types (nonbedded, single raised beds, and two parallel raised beds), three plant population densities (148,300; 269,500; and 432,400 plants/ha), and three mulch treatments (black spray-on, white spray-on, and nontreated soil). The black and white spray-on mulches were applied at a rate of 105 ml/m² using a tractor-mounted pump.\n\nResults indicated that in 1991, neither bed type nor mulch treatments significantly affected total or marketable yields, which averaged 2.4 and 2.2 Mg/ha, respectively. However, in 1993, significant differences emerged; black spray-on mulch increased marketable yield compared to white mulch, while total and marketable yields were significantly higher at the intermediate density of 269,500 plants/ha. The study found that the number of marketable seeds per kilogram was highest with black mulch but not influenced by plant population density.\n\nThe degradation of the spray-on mulch was noted, with both types severely degraded by plant emergence, although remnants of black mulch were present at harvest. This degradation likely limited the mulches' effectiveness in enhancing soil temperature and plant development. The study concluded that while black mulch showed potential for increasing marketable yield, it may have contributed to a decrease in seed size, thus affecting marketability.\n\nOverall, the findings suggest that dry beans should not be cultivated on raised beds under the tested soil conditions, and the use of spray-on mulch requires further evaluation. The optimal planting density for achieving yields around 2 Mg/ha appears to be approximately 269,500 plants/ha, with the study advocating against the use of spray-on mulches and bedding for this cultivar. Future research should explore the mechanisms by which mulch degradation products may influence plant development and yield outcomes."}

Approved in January 1994, ‘Bettersnap’ is designed for optimal production in the southern United States, offering high yields of edible pods, also known as snaps. This cultivar is particularly notable for its resistance to root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) and two significant viral pathogens: blackeye cowpea mosaic virus and southern bean mosaic virus.\n\n‘Bettersnap’ was developed through a conventional backcross breeding method, transferring the dominant Rk gene for nematode resistance from the cultivar ‘Mississippi Cream’ into the snap-type cultivar ‘Snapea’, which is susceptible to these pests. The breeding process resulted in a homozygous line that maintains the desirable traits of ‘Snapea’, including pod characteristics and yield potential. Field tests conducted over two years in Charleston, South Carolina, indicated that ‘Bettersnap’ has comparable maturity and yield to ‘Snapea’, with no significant differences observed (P ≤ 0.05).\n\nMorphologically, ‘Bettersnap’ exhibits a high bush plant habit with a uniform appearance, producing slightly curved pods that are 27 cm long and contain approximately 16 peas. The pods transition in color from dark green at the harvestable snap stage to yellow at green-shell maturity, and finally to light straw when dry. The cultivar's flowers are white, and it lacks red or purple pigmentation on stems and branches. Pod set is concentrated, with mature pods hanging above the foliage, minimizing ground contact.\n\nIn addition to its resistance to nematodes and viruses, ‘Bettersnap’ has shown resistance to scab (Cladosporium vignae) and cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora cruenta), although it remains susceptible to fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum. The cultivar is suitable for multiple uses, including fresh-shell and dry pea production, with fresh peas exhibiting a cream color and kidney shape, while dried peas are tan with a smooth seed coat.\n\n‘Bettersnap’ is recommended for home gardens and commercial processing, particularly for canned and frozen southernpea products. Its adaptability to hot summer months makes it a viable alternative to snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) cultivars in southern states. The breeder's seed has been released to seed producers, and small trial samples are available for research purposes.\n\nThis release contributes significantly to the southernpea industry by providing a cultivar that combines high yield potential with enhanced disease resistance, thereby supporting sustainable agricultural practices in the region."}

The breeding lines were developed to combat over 30 viral diseases affecting common beans, primarily transmitted by insects, with a focus on enhancing resistance through a pyramiding strategy of resistance genes.\n\nThe breeding lines, designated SP 6C, SP 17B, SP 61, SP 180D, and SP 377C, exhibit resistance to several potyviruses, including bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV), broad bean wilt virus (BBWV), blackeye cowpea mosaic virus (BlCMV), clover yellow vein virus (CYVV), and pea mosaic virus (PeMV). Resistance is conferred by a combination of dominant and recessive genes, including the I gene (for BCMV), By-2 (for BYMV), Bcm (for BlCMV), and Cam (for CABMV), among others. The I gene is particularly notable for its temperature-sensitive resistance, which can lead to breakdown under high temperatures, a phenomenon observed in B-21.\n\nThe breeding program utilized a modified single-seed descent (SSD) method, allowing for the selection of resistance to a different virus in each generation. This approach facilitated the identification of homozygous individuals for recessive resistance genes, thereby enhancing the genetic diversity and robustness of the breeding lines. The selection process involved inoculating plants with specific viral strains to assess resistance and tolerance, leading to the advancement of 17 lines to progeny testing, from which five were ultimately selected for release.\n\nMorphologically, the breeding lines are characterized by indeterminate growth habits, with heights ranging up to 50 cm and a canopy structure conducive to pod development. Seed characteristics vary among the lines, with SP 6C exhibiting light tan to brown seeds with black markings, while SP 17B has white seeds with visible veins. Each line demonstrates distinct pod shapes and sizes, contributing to their classification as diverse germplasm.\n\nThe resistance profiles of these lines were rigorously tested against various viral strains, with all five lines showing resistance to BCMV pathotypes NL-3, NL-8, and NY-15, although they varied in response to NL-5. The lines also displayed resistance to other viruses, with specific reactions categorized as resistant with no symptoms, resistant with local lesions, or tolerant with initial symptoms that later cleared.\n\nThe release of these breeding lines is significant for plant breeding efforts aimed at enhancing virus resistance in common beans, providing a valuable resource for breeders seeking to improve crop resilience and yield stability in the face of viral threats. The findings underscore the importance of genetic diversity and the strategic incorporation of resistance genes in breeding programs to develop robust cultivars capable of withstanding multiple viral challenges."}

The germplasm lines were derived from specific crosses involving Michigan State University accessions and were evaluated for yield, seed characteristics, and culinary quality over multiple locations from 1991 to 1994.\n\nThe germplasm lines demonstrated yields averaging 80% of the control cultivar 'Rufus' (2755 kg/ha), with ARS-R93003 being the highest-yielding line at 2314 kg/ha. Seed weights ranged from 33 g/100 seeds (ARS-R93005) to 40 g/100 seeds (ARS-R93006), indicating a potential for enhanced marketability, particularly in regions like East Africa where larger seed sizes are preferred. The lines matured in an average of 82 days, with a range from 76 to 85 days, and exhibited excellent resistance to lodging compared to controls.\n\nResistance to diseases was a focal point, with ARS-R93002 heterozygous for the Ur-3 rust resistance gene, providing high resistance to prevalent rust races. Lines ARS-R93006, ARS-R93007, and ARS-R93008 carried the dominant I gene for resistance to bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), combined with the recessive bc-12 gene, enhancing their resilience against viral infections. However, all lines were susceptible to anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum.\n\nCulinary quality assessments revealed that all germplasm lines had acceptable processing quality indices (PQI), with values ranging from 27.3 to 31.2, surpassing those of 'Garnet'. The hydration and washed-drained weight ratios were optimal, indicating good soakability and processing characteristics. Color measurements indicated that the new lines had brighter seed colors and higher hue angles than the controls, suggesting improved consumer appeal.\n\nThe upright growth habit of these lines aligns with the ideotype for dry bean production, potentially reducing disease risk and improving harvest efficiency in humid environments. The integration of upright pinto bean genetics into small-red bean breeding represents a significant advancement, providing valuable parental lines for future breeding programs aimed at enhancing yield stability and disease resistance in dry beans.\n\nOverall, the release of these germplasm lines marks a notable contribution to the genetic diversity and agronomic potential of small-red beans, with implications for improved breeding strategies and market competitiveness in the dry bean sector."}

Bassett investigates the seedcoat color genotype of the ‘Prim’ cultivar, a Manteca market-class dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and its implications for pigment chemistry and potential digestibility. The research is motivated by anecdotal evidence suggesting that the seedcoat color may correlate with reduced flatulence in beans, particularly in the Chilean Manteca and Coscorrón market classes.\n\nThe inheritance of seedcoat color in ‘Prim’ was analyzed through testcrosses with a series of genetic tester stocks, primarily derived from the recurrent parent 5-593, which has a complex genotype (P [C r] D J G B V Rk Asp). The tester stocks included various combinations of recessive alleles for seedcoat color, allowing for a detailed genetic interpretation of the seedcoat phenotypes observed in the F1 progeny.\n\nThe results indicated that ‘Prim’ possesses the genotype P [C r] d j G b vlae, with the presence of the j allele contributing to a dull seedcoat phenotype. The testcrosses revealed an allelic response with tester stocks P2 and P3, confirming the presence of the j and d alleles in ‘Prim’. Notably, the mottling observed in some progeny was attributed to a heterozygous interaction at the C locus, suggesting a complex genetic background.\n\nThe study also highlights the presence of two flavonol glycosides in the seedcoats of ‘Prim’: kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucoside and kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl (2→1)-O-β-D-xylopyranoside, previously identified in related genotypes. These compounds are of interest due to their potential health benefits and implications for the nutritional profile of the beans.\n\nThe findings contribute to the understanding of seedcoat color inheritance in common beans and its potential link to digestibility traits. The research underscores the importance of genetic characterization in breeding programs aimed at developing varieties with desirable traits, such as improved digestibility and reduced flatulence.

{"doi": "10.21273_HORTSCI.34.4.646", "summary": "In this study, Quintana et al. (1999) investigated the impact of calcium (Ca) fertilizers on the pod calcium concentration and yield of four snap bean cultivars (Phaseolus vulgaris) over two growing seasons (1996 and 1997) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The research aimed to determine whether soil-applied Ca fertilizers could enhance pod Ca levels, which are important for human nutrition, particularly as snap beans are a low-oxalate source of calcium.\n\nThe experimental design employed a randomized complete block with a factorial arrangement of treatments, including four cultivars—Labrador (low accumulator), Hystyle and Evergreen (intermediate accumulators), and Top Crop (high accumulator)—and three Ca fertilizer treatments: calcium sulfate (CaSO4·2H2O), calcium nitrate [Ca(NO3)2], and a control (no Ca applied). Each treatment was replicated six times, with yield and pod Ca concentration measured at harvest.\n\nResults indicated no significant effects of either Ca fertilizer on pod Ca concentration or yield, with mean pod Ca concentrations ranging from 4.92 to 5.12 mg·g–1 dry weight across treatments. The cultivar 'Evergreen' exhibited the highest pod Ca concentration (5.47 mg·g–1), while 'Labrador' had the lowest (4.10 mg·g–1). Yield differences were also significant, with 'Hystyle' yielding the most (11.27 t·ha–1) and 'Labrador' the least (7.77 t·ha–1). Notably, no significant interactions between fertilizer type and cultivar were observed.\n\nEnvironmental factors played a role in the observed variations, with year effects significantly influencing both pod Ca concentration and yield. The higher precipitation in 1997 (260 mm) compared to 1996 (126 mm) likely facilitated greater calcium transport to the roots, enhancing pod Ca accumulation. The study also noted that the soil's initial calcium levels were sufficient for normal bean development, suggesting that additional Ca fertilization may not be necessary.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of genetic variation among cultivars in determining pod Ca concentration and yield, indicating that breeding efforts may be more effective than fertilization strategies in enhancing calcium accumulation in snap beans. This research contributes to understanding the nutritional potential of snap beans and highlights the need for further exploration of genetic factors influencing calcium uptake and accumulation in legumes. \n\nOverall, the study concludes that while calcium nutrition is vital for human health, the application of calcium fertilizers did not enhance pod calcium levels or yield in the tested snap bean cultivars, emphasizing the significance of cultivar selection in breeding programs aimed at improving nutritional quality."}

The cultivar was bred to combine multiple disease resistances with desirable agronomic traits, including an upright growth habit that enhances air circulation and reduces the incidence of white mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum).\n\nThe breeding process involved intercrossing advanced lines derived from both adapted and exotic parents, utilizing pedigree selection to develop near-homozygous lines. Notably, ‘Weihing’ carries the resistance genes Ur-3 and Ur-6, which confer resistance to rust, as confirmed through greenhouse inoculation tests. The cultivar demonstrated moderate resistance to common blight and halo blight, with disease symptoms recorded as a percentage of leaf area affected. In field tests, ‘Weihing’ exhibited a low to moderate white mold infection rate (12% to 30%), while control cultivars showed higher susceptibility.\n\nThe performance of ‘Weihing’ was evaluated through a randomized complete-block design across multiple disease nurseries and on-farm trials, revealing comparable seed yields (approximately 2092 kg·ha–1) to standard cultivars ‘Beryl’ and ‘Harris’. Seed weight was also similar, with ‘Weihing’ seeds weighing between 29 to 40 g/100 seeds, heavier than ‘Beryl’ (25 to 34 g/100 seeds). Maturity was slightly delayed in ‘Weihing’ (90-95 days) compared to ‘Beryl’ (85-90 days) and ‘Harris’ (93-98 days).\n\nThe architectural traits of ‘Weihing’, characterized by a more upright and porous canopy, are critical for its avoidance strategy against white mold, as they facilitate better air circulation and quicker drying of foliage. This trait is particularly important given the lack of high physiological resistance to white mold in common beans. Furthermore, ‘Weihing’ possesses the dominant I gene, providing resistance to certain strains of bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), although it remains susceptible to BCMNV.\n\nThe release of ‘Weihing’ is expected to enhance the stability of seed yields and quality while reducing the need for pesticide applications, thereby lowering production costs for growers. The cultivar is now available for planting, with certified seed expected to contribute positively to the Great Northern dry bean market in Nebraska and beyond.

PWV, a member of the Potyviridae family, causes significant foliar symptoms in infected plants, including mosaic patterns, vein banding, and stunting. The research identifies a single dominant gene, tentatively designated as Pwv, responsible for resistance to the Australian strain PWV-K, as well as three additional strains (PWV-Mild, PWV-51, and PWV-Tip Blight).\n\nThe inheritance studies were conducted using resistant cultivars such as ‘Black Turtle 1’, ‘Clipper’, and ‘RedKote’, crossed with susceptible cultivars like ‘Black Turtle 2’, ‘California Light Red Kidney’, and ‘Pioneer’. The results indicated that F1 progeny exhibited local infection without systemic spread, while F2 populations segregated in a 3:1 ratio (resistant:susceptible), confirming the dominant nature of the resistance gene. Backcross populations further supported these findings, showing a 1:1 segregation ratio in susceptible backgrounds, reinforcing the presence of a dominant resistance factor.\n\nThe study utilized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to confirm viral infection and assess the systemic movement of PWV in various bean lines. The resistant cultivars remained free of systemic symptoms, while susceptible lines developed severe symptoms upon inoculation. The research highlights that the resistance conferred by the Pwv gene is non-strain-specific, as it effectively provided resistance against multiple PWV strains.\n\nAdditionally, the study emphasizes the need for further research on the distribution of PWV in common bean crops, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where the virus is prevalent in Passiflora species. The findings suggest that the Pwv gene can be incorporated into susceptible bean cultivars through traditional breeding methods, potentially enhancing resistance to PWV in agricultural practices.\n\nIn summary, this research elucidates the genetic basis of resistance to PWV in common beans, identifying a dominant gene that can be leveraged in breeding programs to improve resistance against this economically significant virus.

The F2 progeny from these crosses were inoculated with the bacterial strain F19-W and evaluated for disease reaction using a scoring system ranging from 1 (resistant) to 5 (susceptible). The observed segregation ratios in the F2 populations were consistent with a 1 resistant to 3 susceptible ratio, indicating that resistance is likely controlled by a single recessive gene. The F3 generation from one cross exhibited a 1 resistant to 2 heterozygous to 1 susceptible ratio, further supporting the hypothesis of monogenic inheritance.\n\nThe study also noted variability in symptom expression among susceptible plants, suggesting the presence of additional modifying genes that could influence resistance expression. The resistant lines demonstrated a high level of resistance, with scores of 1-2, while susceptible parents scored 4-5, indicating significant differences in disease response.\n\nThe research utilized greenhouse conditions for disease screening, maintaining a controlled environment with specific temperature and humidity settings. The inoculation methods included both multiple puncture and tissue infusion techniques, which were validated to yield consistent results in disease assessment.\n\nThe findings highlight the potential of *P. coccineus* as a source of CBB resistance, which has not been fully exploited in breeding programs. The recessive nature of the resistance gene identified could facilitate its incorporation into *P. vulgaris* breeding lines without compromising desirable agronomic traits.

BCMNV includes several strains, with NL-8 identified as particularly virulent, causing systemic necrosis in susceptible cultivars. The research identifies a single dominant gene conferring resistance to BCMNV-NL8, which was observed in the resistant cultivars ‘California Light Red Kidney’ (CLRK) and ‘Carbon’. \n\nCrosses were made between resistant cultivars (CLRK and Carbon) and susceptible ones (Sanilac and Black Turtle 2, BT-2). The F1 progeny exhibited local hypersensitive reactions but were systemically resistant to NL-8. Segregation analysis of F2 populations revealed a 3:1 ratio of resistant to susceptible plants, confirming the dominance of the resistance factor. Backcrosses to resistant parents produced all resistant progeny, while backcrosses to susceptible parents yielded a 1:1 ratio, further supporting the inheritance model.\n\nThe study also highlights the differential responses of various cultivars to BCMNV strains. For instance, while 23 snap and dry bean cultivars were resistant to NL-8, they showed susceptibility to other BCMNV strains (NL3, NL5) and BCMV strains. This suggests that resistance mechanisms may vary among strains, emphasizing the need for targeted breeding strategies.\n\nAnalytical methods included enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to confirm viral presence and assess resistance. The study underscores the importance of understanding genetic resistance mechanisms in the context of breeding programs aimed at developing resilient bean cultivars. The findings contribute to the broader knowledge of potyvirus resistance in legumes and highlight the necessity for ongoing research into the genetic factors controlling resistance to various BCMNV strains.\n\nIn conclusion, the identification of a single dominant resistance gene against BCMNV-NL8 in common beans provides a valuable tool for breeders. This research not only enhances our understanding of bean-virus interactions but also lays the groundwork for developing cultivars that can withstand viral pressures, which is crucial for maintaining bean production in affected regions.

The injury ratings, based on a scale from 1 (no injury) to 5 (severe injury), indicated a discrete distribution among F2 plants and a quantitative inheritance pattern in F3 families. The analysis of variance showed significant variances among F3 families, supporting the hypothesis of genetic control over resistance traits.\n\nThe study highlights that the resistance mechanisms in the evaluated parents are not fully understood, although previous research suggests tolerance as a primary mechanism. The authors note that environmental factors significantly affect the heritability estimates, complicating the selection process for breeding resistant cultivars. The findings emphasize the need for high selection pressure in breeding programs due to the low heritability estimates.\n\nThe research underscores the potential for developing resistant dry bean cultivars as a sustainable alternative to chemical insecticides, which have environmental drawbacks. The authors advocate for the use of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for more precise heritability estimates and suggest that integrating molecular markers linked to resistance genes could enhance breeding strategies through marker-assisted selection (MAS).\n\nOverall, this study provides critical insights into the genetic basis of PLH resistance in dry beans, laying the groundwork for future breeding efforts aimed at improving pest resistance and reducing reliance on chemical controls. Further research is warranted to explore additional genetic variability and resistance mechanisms in broader bean germplasm."}

The research aims to enhance the genetic diversity and agronomic traits of common beans, particularly focusing on traits such as resistance to common bacterial blight (CBB) caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli, as well as drought and heat stress tolerance.\n\nThe germplasm lines were derived from backcrossing a self-sterile interspecific hybrid with various recurrent common bean parents, including both small- and large-seeded varieties. The tepary bean, recognized for its resilience in semi-arid environments, serves as a potential donor of desirable traits, although it also presents challenges such as susceptibility to certain pathogens and adverse environmental conditions. The study highlights the pronounced reproductive barriers between the two species, necessitating embryo rescue techniques for successful hybridization.\n\nThe research utilized a pedigree method for selection, focusing on agronomic characteristics such as maturity, growth habit, and yield potential. The selected OPG lines were evaluated across multiple locations in Ohio and Ontario, Canada, revealing that most lines exhibited yields comparable to the check cultivar ‘Jamapa’. Notably, the lines displayed a range of architectural types from upright bush to prostrate vine, with varying degrees of indeterminacy.\n\nAnalytical methods included disease resistance assessments through artificial inoculation with local strains of X. campestris pv. phaseoli, which confirmed that some lines exhibited resistance, although this trait was segregating within the lines. The study also assessed seed characteristics, including water imbibition and cookability, finding that most lines performed similarly to commercial checks, with one line (OPG-1) showing slower water absorption.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential for utilizing tepary bean germplasm to broaden the genetic base of common beans, particularly for traits related to disease resistance and environmental stress tolerance. The research contributes to ongoing efforts in plant breeding aimed at improving common bean cultivars, with implications for enhancing food security and agricultural sustainability in regions prone to biotic and abiotic stresses.\n\nOverall, this work not only provides new germplasm resources but also addresses the complexities of introgressing desirable traits from tepary beans into common beans, paving the way for future breeding strategies that could yield improved cultivars with enhanced resilience and productivity."}

Griffiths details the release of six new dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) breeding lines—Cornell 601 (pink kidney), Cornell 602 (white kidney), Cornell 603 (dark red kidney), Cornell 604 (black bean), Cornell 605 (light red kidney), and Cornell 606 (black kidney)—which exhibit high levels of resistance to white mold caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This resistance is critical due to the significant impact of white mold on bean yield and quality globally.\n\nThe breeding lines were developed through a systematic selection process involving greenhouse evaluations and multistate field trials as part of the w-1150 regional project. The selection utilized a modified \"straw test,\" which correlates well with field resistance, to assess resistance levels by inoculating plant petioles with pathogen mycelia. The lines were derived from an initial cross between the red kidney bean cultivar Redkote and Cornell snap bean breeding line 6603, which itself was developed from two other snap bean lines.\n\nPerformance evaluations indicated that these breeding lines differ in market class and seed type, with Cornell 601 and 602 being smaller kidney beans, while Cornell 604 and 606 are larger black beans. Notably, Cornell 604 and 606 exhibited mean seed weights greater than those of commercial black bean varieties, suggesting potential for market competitiveness.\n\nField trials conducted from 2004 to 2007 demonstrated the breeding lines' resistance to white mold, with Cornell 601 achieving a notable second place in resistance rankings among 13 entries in 2004. Subsequent years saw Cornell 604 and 606 also performing well, indicating consistent resistance across multiple environments. The results were quantified using a disease severity rating scale, where lower scores indicated better resistance.\n\nIn terms of agronomic performance, Cornell 601 yielded 2946 lb/acre with a maturity of 97 days, comparable to the California Early Light Red Kidney. Other lines, such as Cornell 603 and 604, also showed competitive yields relative to their respective controls. However, data for Cornell 602 and 606 were not available at the time of publication.\n\nThe significance of these breeding lines lies in their potential use as germplasm resources for developing commercial cultivars with enhanced resistance to white mold, thereby contributing to improved yield stability and quality in dry bean production. The study underscores the importance of breeding strategies that incorporate disease resistance traits, which are vital for sustainable agricultural practices in bean cultivation.

The research focuses on two specific cultivars, 'Matterhorn' (Type II, erect indeterminate) and 'Poncho' (Type III, prostrate indeterminate), assessing their responses to GA3 concentrations ranging from 62.5 to 16,000 ppm.\n\nThe results indicate that 'Poncho' exhibits a higher sensitivity to GA3 compared to 'Matterhorn'. Maximum stem elongation for 'Poncho' was achieved at 1000 ppm GA3, while 'Matterhorn' required 2000 ppm for similar effects. Foliar applications further revealed that 'Poncho' responded significantly to as low as 0.25 ppm GA3, reaching maximum height at 8 ppm, whereas 'Matterhorn' required 64 ppm to show significant growth, plateauing at 512 ppm. Notably, GA3 application inhibited flowering in 'Poncho' at concentrations of 128 ppm and higher, while 'Matterhorn' remained unaffected.\n\nThe study also categorized the GA3 sensitivity of additional cultivars, revealing a spectrum of responses. Type I cultivars (determinate) displayed varied sensitivity, with some requiring as much as 2048 ppm for maximum elongation, while others responded similarly to Type III cultivars at lower concentrations. This suggests that GA3 sensitivity may not correlate directly with growth habit or market class but rather indicates a genetic variability among cultivars.\n\nThe research underscores the necessity for cultivar-specific evaluations of GA3 sensitivity through short-term greenhouse bioassays prior to field applications. This approach could optimize the use of GA3 to enhance lower internode growth, thereby improving the feasibility of direct harvesting methods and potentially mitigating yield losses associated with conventional harvesting practices.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings present a clear delineation of GA3 sensitivity among common bean cultivars, emphasizing the importance of understanding these differences for effective agricultural practices and breeding strategies aimed at improving crop yield and harvest efficiency."}

(2012), the accumulation patterns of fructose, glucose, and sucrose in snap and dry bean pods (Phaseolus vulgaris) were investigated across six diverse cultivars over two growing seasons. Utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the researchers quantified alcohol-soluble sugars during pod development, revealing significant cultivar-dependent variations in sugar content and accumulation patterns.\n\nThe analysis indicated that in snap bean cultivars, fructose and glucose concentrations generally decreased as pod size increased, while sucrose levels rose. Conversely, the dry bean cultivar 'Puebla 152' exhibited an increase in fructose and glucose with pod size, with sucrose levels remaining stable. Notably, no significant year-by-genotype interactions were observed, suggesting consistent sugar accumulation patterns across the studied years.\n\nThe study identified that sieve sizes No. 3 (7.34 to 8.33 mm) and No. 4 (8.33 to 9.52 mm) pods were optimal for differentiating sugar concentrations among genotypes. The findings highlighted that the snap bean cultivars with larger pod diameters, such as 'Black Blue Lake Pole' (BBLP), 'Eagle', and 'Hystyle', had higher mean concentrations of fructose and glucose compared to smaller sieve cultivars like 'Ferrari' and 'Roma II'. In contrast, the latter exhibited the highest sucrose concentrations.\n\nThe research also elucidated the role of acid invertase, an enzyme responsible for sucrose hydrolysis into monosaccharides, in sugar accumulation dynamics. In snap beans, the activity of acid invertase peaked during early pod development, correlating with the observed decrease in monosaccharides and the subsequent increase in sucrose as pods matured. This pattern suggests that the metabolic pathways governing sugar accumulation differ between snap and dry beans, with the latter potentially utilizing alternative enzymatic pathways or mechanisms for sugar accumulation.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant for plant breeding and consumer preference. The variation in sugar concentrations among cultivars indicates potential for breeding programs to select for sweeter varieties, which could enhance consumer acceptance and marketability. Additionally, understanding the biochemical pathways involved in sugar accumulation can inform strategies to improve flavor profiles in snap beans, which are not traditionally recognized for their sweetness but are increasingly valued for their taste attributes.\n\nOverall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of sugar dynamics in snap and dry beans, contributing valuable insights into the genetic and biochemical factors influencing flavor and consumer preference in these important vegetable crops."}

Conducted at Egerton University, the research involved two trials comparing three treatments: open field with insecticide (alpha-cypermethrin), untreated agronet cover, and treated agronet cover. The agronets, made from high-density polyethylene with a pore size of 0.9 mm x 0.7 mm, were designed to modify environmental conditions around the crop.\n\nKey findings indicate that agronet coverage significantly altered the microclimate, resulting in a 10% increase in air temperature, a 4% increase in relative humidity, and a 20% increase in soil moisture compared to control plots. However, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and daily light integral (DLI) were reduced by approximately 1% and 11.5%, respectively, under agronet covers. The enhanced microclimate contributed to a 2-day advancement in seedling emergence and improved overall plant development, with agronet-covered plants exhibiting more leaves and branches.\n\nPest populations of silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and black bean aphids (Aphis fabae) were significantly lower under agronet covers, particularly with treated agronets, which demonstrated a more effective pest control mechanism. The treated agronets reduced pest populations more effectively than untreated ones on specific sampling dates.\n\nYield assessments revealed that agronet-covered plants produced 30% more pods and 40% heavier total pod weight compared to the control. Additionally, pod quality improved, with agronet treatments yielding longer and thicker pods, meeting export quality standards. The study suggests that agronets can reduce reliance on chemical insecticides, thereby addressing food safety concerns related to pesticide residues in export markets.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of agronets presents a viable, eco-friendly strategy for improving French bean production in Kenya, enhancing both yield and quality while minimizing environmental impact. The authors recommend further research to explore the applicability of agronets across various French bean varieties and growing conditions, as well as an economic analysis of their implementation."}

The research addresses the growing consumer demand for organic heirloom beans, which has led to a significant increase in organic dry bean acreage in the region.\n\nThe study involved 17 heirloom cultivars, including notable varieties such as ‘Jacob’s Cattle Gold’, ‘Lina Sisco’s Bird Egg’, ‘Peregion’, and ‘Tiger’s Eye’, which were assessed for yield and yield stability over two growing seasons (2013 and 2014) at four organic production sites. The mean yield of heirloom cultivars was found to be 44% lower than that of commercial checks, with yields ranging from 825 to 2127 kg·ha⁻¹ and an average of 1362 kg·ha⁻¹. The analysis utilized static and dynamic stability biplot methods to evaluate yield stability, revealing that cultivars like ‘Jacob’s Cattle Gold’ exhibited both high yield and low coefficient of variation (CV), indicating potential for stable production.\n\nThe study highlights the economic viability of heirloom cultivars, particularly in niche markets, where consumers are willing to pay a premium for unique traits such as flavor and cooking quality. The average willingness to pay for heirloom beans was reported at $10.52 per kilogram, compared to $6.27 for non-heirloom varieties. This price differential, combined with the relatively close yield performance of heirloom cultivars, suggests that they can be a profitable option for small-scale organic producers.\n\nStatistical analyses indicated significant variance contributions from environmental factors and cultivar interactions, with a notable lack of correlation between environmental conditions and yield outcomes. The research emphasizes the importance of stability assessments in cultivar selection, as some heirloom varieties, despite lower yields, demonstrated resilience across varying conditions.\n\nOverall, this study provides critical insights into the potential of heirloom dry beans in organic agriculture, advocating for their inclusion in local production systems to meet consumer demand while offering economic benefits to growers. Further research is suggested to explore breeding strategies that could enhance the agronomic traits of heirloom cultivars, thereby improving their competitiveness against commercial varieties."}

The beans were grown in two contrasting environments in Michigan, Montcalm (irrigated) and Saginaw Valley (rainfed), and assessed for paste-making qualities including yield, color, flavor, and stickiness.\n\nKey findings revealed significant genotype × environment (G × E) interactions affecting paste quality traits. Notably, 'Snowdon' exhibited superior paste yield and whiteness in both environments, while 'Powderhorn' demonstrated high stickiness, which is desirable for paste texture. The cranberry bean produced a darker paste with higher flavor intensity, indicating its distinct sensory profile compared to the white cultivars.\n\nAnalytical methods included image analysis for color measurement, yielding L* (lightness), a* (redness), and b* (yellowness) values. The study found that seedcoat percentage and the ratio of L* to C* could serve as predictive indicators for paste yield and whiteness, respectively. Sensory evaluations confirmed that all white cultivars had low flavor intensity, comparable to the control cultivar Hime, while the cranberry bean was noted for its stronger flavor.\n\nThe research underscores the potential of specific white bean cultivars for paste production, suggesting that their use could diversify processed bean applications in the U.S. The findings also highlight the importance of environmental conditions on seed and paste quality, indicating that irrigation may enhance certain desirable traits.

Russo investigates the impact of soil depth and tillage methods on the yield of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), specifically black beans and pinto beans, in southeastern Oklahoma. The research addresses a gap in understanding how varying soil depths and tillage practices affect bean production, particularly in regions with clay hardpans.\n\nThe experimental design involved a 3.24-ha commercial field where soil samples were collected at 496 grid points to assess pH and nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) across different soil depths categorized as <25 cm, 25-50 cm, 50-75 cm, and >75 cm. Two tillage methods were employed: conventional tillage (clean cultivation) and reduced tillage (planting into standing residue). Irrigation was applied at critical growth stages (50% flowering and pod set) to ensure adequate moisture.\n\nResults indicated that black bean yields under conventional tillage averaged 1166 kg·ha–1, significantly outperforming reduced tillage yields of 136 kg·ha–1. Pinto beans showed similar trends with conventional tillage yielding 611 kg·ha–1 compared to 403 kg·ha–1 for reduced tillage. Notably, yields generally decreased with increasing soil depth, particularly under conventional tillage, suggesting that shallower soils may provide better access to nutrients and moisture.\n\nThe study highlights that while reduced tillage is often promoted for its environmental benefits, it did not compensate for the yield reductions observed in this experiment. The findings suggest that deeper soils may require more water than what was provided, potentially leading to nutrient leaching and reduced plant performance. The authors emphasize the need for further research to optimize dry bean production conditions in the Southern Plains, particularly regarding the interplay between soil depth, water availability, and nutrient distribution.\n\nOverall, this research contributes valuable insights into the agronomic practices for dry bean cultivation, underscoring the importance of soil management and tillage systems in enhancing crop yields.

(1990), the interactions between three pathogens affecting dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)—common bacterial blight (Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli, Xcp), rust (Uromyces appendiculatus var. appendiculatus, Ua), and bean common mosaic virus (BCMV, NY-15 strain)—were investigated through growth chamber experiments involving ten cultivars with varying susceptibility to rust. The primary objective was to assess the effects of coinoculation on disease severity and to evaluate the potential for simultaneous screening of resistance to multiple pathogens.\n\nThe researchers employed a split-plot design to analyze the effects of Ua and Xcp coinoculation. Results indicated that the presence of Ua significantly altered the symptoms caused by Xcp, with necrosis extending beyond rust pustules depending on the host's susceptibility. This phenomenon, termed \"bacterial-rust necrosis,\" was characterized by distinct lesions surrounding rust pustules, suggesting that the interaction between these pathogens exacerbates leaf damage. The correlation between rust index and lesion size in bacterial-rust necrosis was notably high, indicating a strong relationship between susceptibility to both pathogens.\n\nIn a separate experiment, the impact of BCMV on rust development was evaluated. Prior infection with BCMV reduced the size of rust pustules in certain cultivars but did not alter the overall susceptibility classification of the cultivars. This finding suggests that while BCMV may mitigate some symptoms of rust, it does not confer resistance. The study concluded that simultaneous inoculation with BCMV and rust could be effectively utilized in breeding programs aimed at developing cultivars resistant to both pathogens.\n\nThe interactions between Xcp and BCMV were also explored, revealing no significant differences in symptoms when inoculated separately or together, indicating a lack of synergistic or antagonistic effects at the seedling stage. This aligns with previous findings that suggested such interactions may manifest later in the growing season.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of understanding pathogen interactions in the context of plant breeding for disease resistance. The findings support the feasibility of simultaneous screening for multiple diseases, which is particularly relevant in regions where these pathogens co-occur.

(1990), the inheritance of culinary quality traits in dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was investigated using a diallel cross involving eight diverse parental lines. The research aimed to elucidate the genetic control of nine key traits related to culinary quality, which are critical for both consumer acceptance and processing efficiency. The traits assessed included soaked bean weight (SBWT), soaked bean water content (SBWC), clumping (CLMP), split beans (SPLT), washed-drained weight (WDWT), washed-drained weight coefficient (WDWTR), and texture (TEXT).\n\nThe study revealed significant genetic variability among the parental lines and their F2 and F3 progenies, as evidenced by analyses of variance. General combining ability (GCA) effects were found to be highly significant for most traits, indicating that additive genetic variance predominated in the expression of culinary quality traits. In contrast, specific combining ability (SCA) effects were significant for certain traits, suggesting that nonadditive genetic effects also played a role, particularly for TEXT and WDWT. The GCA:SCA ratios indicated that additive effects were more influential for traits like SBWT and SBWC, while both additive and nonadditive effects contributed to CLMP and TEXT.\n\nThe study employed graphical analysis of variance (Vr on Wr) to assess the genetic architecture underlying these traits. The results indicated that the genes controlling TEXT exhibited partial dominance, while those influencing WDWT showed complete dominance. This suggests that breeding strategies focusing on recurrent selection could effectively enhance culinary quality traits, particularly those governed by additive genetic effects.\n\nNotably, the research highlighted the negative correlation between TEXT and WDWT, indicating that simultaneous improvement of both traits may be challenging. The authors proposed that tandem selection or the development of a selection index could be viable strategies for addressing this trade-off in breeding programs.\n\nOverall, the findings underscore the heritable nature of culinary quality traits in dry beans and provide valuable insights for breeders aiming to enhance these characteristics through genetic selection.

Conducted across three locations in Rwanda over five harvests, the research aims to optimize resource allocation for evaluating these traits, which are critical for food security and fuel conservation in regions where beans are a dietary staple.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the genotypic variance component was significantly larger than the genotype × environment interaction for both cooking time and water absorption, indicating a strong genetic influence on these traits. Specifically, the genotypic variance accounted for 25% of the total variance in cooking time and 52% in water absorption, while no significant genotypic effect was found for protein content. The phenotypic correlation between cooking time and water absorption was negative (-0.37), suggesting that slower-cooking beans tend to absorb less water, but this correlation was insufficient to support the use of water absorption as a reliable indirect selection criterion for cooking time.\n\nThe study identified that the most efficient testing protocol for cooking time involved four replications over two harvests at two locations, while water absorption could be effectively evaluated with four replications over two harvests at a single location. These findings are particularly relevant for breeding programs aiming to develop cultivars with improved cooking efficiency, which could lead to significant fuelwood savings in Rwanda, estimated at 150,000 Mg annually if faster-cooking cultivars were adopted.\n\nThe research also highlights the environmental impact on water absorption, with significant differences observed across locations correlating with temperature and precipitation. Notably, seeds from the driest location absorbed the most water, indicating intrinsic seed characteristics may influence this trait.\n\nDespite the lack of significant differences in protein content among cultivars, the study underscores the challenge of selecting for high protein levels due to substantial genotype × environment interactions. The authors suggest that maintaining a protein content of 20-22% while selecting for agronomically superior, fast-cooking cultivars may be a more feasible breeding goal.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the genetic and environmental factors influencing food quality traits in common beans, offering a framework for resource-efficient testing procedures that can enhance breeding strategies aimed at improving nutritional quality and cooking efficiency in dry beans."}

Bassett reports the induction and characterization of a blue flower color mutant in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) through gamma irradiation. The mutation, designated as blu, is controlled by a single recessive gene that is not allelic to the previously identified genes V or Sal, which are known to influence flower color. Linkage analysis revealed that the blu locus is associated with the Fin locus, which governs plant habit (indeterminate vs. determinate), with a tentative linkage estimate of approximately 27 cM, although variability in the data limits the conclusiveness of this estimate.\n\nThe research builds on previous genetic studies of flower color in common bean, referencing foundational work by Yarnell (1965) and Leakey (1988). The inheritance pattern observed in F2 progenies from crosses involving the blu mutant supports a 3:1 segregation ratio for flower color, consistent with the hypothesis that blu is a recessive trait. Further allelism tests confirmed that blu is distinct from both the Sal locus, which produces red flower colors, and the V locus, which affects color expression in the presence of other alleles.\n\nThe methodology involved treating dry seeds of a Florida breeding line with gamma radiation, followed by selection and progeny testing in subsequent generations. The inheritance tests included multiple crosses, with detailed phenotypic classifications of flower colors based on the Royal Horticultural Society's color charts. The results indicated that the blue flower phenotype (methyl-violet) arises in the absence of dominant alleles at the V and Sal loci, suggesting a unique genetic pathway for this color expression.\n\nLinkage tests were conducted using crosses between the blue-flower mutant and various lines with known flower colors, revealing significant disturbances in segregation ratios at both the blu and Fin loci. This indicates potential genetic interactions or epistatic relationships affecting flower color and plant habit. Notably, the combination of the blu allele with the Fin locus resulted in reduced fertility in determinate segregants, highlighting the complexities of breeding for this trait.\n\nThe findings contribute to the understanding of flower color genetics in common bean and provide a basis for future breeding programs aimed at developing new flower color variants. The identification of the blu gene offers potential applications in ornamental breeding and may enhance the aesthetic appeal of common bean cultivars. The research underscores the importance of genetic diversity and mutation breeding in crop improvement, particularly in the context of flower color traits."}

Bassett investigates the characterization and inheritance of four induced leaf mutants in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) as part of a broader effort to enhance genetic markers for mapping studies. The mutants were generated through gamma radiation treatment (20 krad) of dry seeds from breeding line 182-1, leading to the identification of the following phenotypes: chlorotic moderately lanceolate leaf (CML), leaf-bleaching dwarf (LBD), glossy bronzing leaf (GLB), and overlapping leaflets (OL). Each mutant is controlled by a single recessive gene, with proposed symbols: cml, lbd, glb, and ol, respectively.\n\nInheritance studies demonstrated that F2 populations from crosses between these mutants and normal plants segregated in a 3:1 ratio, confirming the recessive nature of the mutations. The CML mutant exhibited moderate chlorosis and adequate vegetative vigor, while the OL mutant displayed overlapping leaflets that failed to orient in response to light. The GLB mutant had a glossy leaf surface with bronzing patches under bright sunlight, and the LBD mutant was characterized by dwarfing and irregular chlorophyll degradation, resulting in creamy white patches on leaves.\n\nBackcrossing of the mutants to the recurrent parent 5-593 further validated the inheritance patterns, with BC-F2 populations also fitting the expected 3:1 segregation ratio. However, the LBD mutant showed a significant deviation due to environmental stress interactions, specifically with herbicide application, which adversely affected seedling survival.\n\nLinkage tests involving the cml mutant and nine other previously reported marker mutants revealed no significant linkages, suggesting that cml is independent of other loci in the common bean genome. This study contributes to the understanding of genetic variability in common bean and provides valuable markers for breeding programs aimed at improving traits such as stress response and plant morphology.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of induced mutations as a strategy for expanding the repertoire of genetic markers in common bean, which is crucial for enhancing breeding efficiency and developing cultivars with desirable traits. The research highlights the importance of environmental factors in mutant expression and survival, emphasizing the need for careful management in breeding programs.

The research aimed to optimize conditions for in vitro regeneration of these legumes, which are significant for agricultural production and genetic transformation studies.\n\nThe authors germinated seeds of two common bean lines (Xan-159 and Pinto 'Agate') and one faba bean cultivar ('Coprosi') on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with B5 vitamins and varying concentrations of BA (2.5, 5.0, or 7.5 µM). Seedlings were grown under either dark conditions or continuous light for 14 days. The results indicated that explants from seedlings germinated in darkness exhibited significantly higher shoot regeneration rates and shoot numbers per explant compared to those grown in light, with optimal results observed at 5 µM BA.\n\nSubsequent experiments evaluated the effects of CPPU and TDZ at concentrations of 0.25 to 5.0 µM on shoot organogenesis. The study found that lower concentrations (0.25 to 1.0 µM) of CPPU and TDZ significantly enhanced shoot bud initiation and development, yielding two to five times more shoots per explant than the optimal BA concentration. In contrast, higher concentrations of CPPU and TDZ inhibited shoot elongation and promoted callus formation, indicating a concentration-dependent response.\n\nHistological analyses revealed that adventitious meristems began to form 6 to 8 days post-culture initiation, confirming the effectiveness of the cytokinin treatments in promoting organogenesis. The regenerated plants were morphologically similar to those derived from original seed stocks, suggesting genetic stability in the regeneration process.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of dark preconditioning and the use of specific cytokinin-like compounds in enhancing shoot organogenesis in legumes. This research not only contributes to the understanding of plant regeneration mechanisms in common and faba beans but also holds potential implications for genetic transformation protocols, as increased shoot regeneration could facilitate the production of transgenic plants. The study provides a foundation for future research aimed at improving tissue culture techniques and enhancing the genetic improvement of these economically important crops."}

Bassett reports the identification and characterization of a novel gene for flower color pattern, designated as white banner (wb), derived from an interspecific hybridization between the common bean (*Phaseolus vulgaris*) and the scarlet runner bean (*Phaseolus coccineus*). The wb phenotype is characterized by a distinct flower morphology featuring a white banner petal and pale violet wings (color code: veronica-violet 639/2).\n\nThe inheritance of the wb trait was investigated through crosses involving the breeding line 5-593, which exhibits bishops-violet flowers, and genetic stocks with varying flower colors. The segregation patterns observed in F2 and F3 progenies indicated that wb is controlled by a single recessive gene that is nonallelic to the V locus, responsible for other flower color variations. An allelism test with a blue flower marker (blu) further confirmed that wb is not allelic with blu.\n\nThe research utilized various analytical methods, including segregation analysis and chi-square tests, to assess the inheritance patterns. The F2 populations from the cross v BC2 5-593 × WB showed a segregation ratio consistent with a two-factor model, supporting the hypothesis of wb being a recessive trait. Notably, the study revealed a deficiency in the transmission of the wb allele, suggesting potential linkage to other genes that may affect its segregation.\n\nThe findings contribute to the understanding of flower color genetics in common beans, with implications for plant breeding. The wb gene adds to the existing repertoire of genetic markers available for breeding programs aimed at enhancing flower color diversity. The study also discusses the relationship of wb with other known loci, such as rkd, noting that wb does not produce the same phenotypic effects as rkd, which results in pure-white flowers with fine red veins.\n\nOverall, the identification of the wb gene enhances the genetic toolkit for breeders and provides insights into the complex genetic interactions governing flower color in beans. Future research may focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the wb phenotype and exploring its potential applications in breeding for ornamental traits."}

The research employed stab-inoculation of germinating seeds, revealing significant genotypic differences in tumor frequency and size after three weeks. The wild line UW 325 exhibited the highest tumorigenesis rate (58.7%), while the cultivar ‘Olathe’ showed the lowest (24.4%). \n\nThe study also assessed phytohormone sensitivity through in vitro culture of excised shoot tips, indicating that ‘Montcalm’ and ‘Tendergreen’ were highly responsive, correlating with their tumorigenic potential. In contrast, ‘Olathe’ demonstrated low sensitivity and tumor formation. GUS assays using the disarmed strain C58C1(pGV3850/pKIWI105) revealed that UW 325 had the highest GUS activity (169.6 pM/mg per min 4-MU), while ‘Montcalm’ had a paradoxically low GUS expression despite high tumorigenesis, suggesting a complex relationship between phytohormone sensitivity and transformation efficiency.\n\nHistochemical analysis confirmed that 60% of the shoot apexes from UW 325 exhibited transformation events, with GUS expression localized in the meristematic regions. The study found that the addition of acetosyringone did not significantly alter the genotypic differences in susceptibility, indicating that inherent genetic factors primarily govern transformation rates.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of stab-inoculation as a rapid transformation method for common beans, bypassing the need for tissue culture regeneration. The results also highlight the importance of understanding the genetic basis of susceptibility to Agrobacterium, which could inform breeding strategies aimed at enhancing transformation efficiency in legumes. This research contributes to the broader field of plant biotechnology by elucidating the mechanisms underlying Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in common beans, with implications for genetic engineering and crop improvement."}

The research aimed to identify cultivar-specific differences in susceptibility to leafhopper injury, quantify the relationship between injury and yield, and assess the effectiveness of insecticide application in managing leafhopper populations.\n\nThe experimental design included a split-plot arrangement, with main plots receiving insecticide treatment (protected) versus those left untreated (unprotected). The cultivars exhibited significant variability in leafhopper injury ratings, seed yield, and biomass across all years. Notably, the cultivars ‘Tacaragua’ (black-seeded) and ‘Sierra’ (pinto) demonstrated high resistance to leafhopper injury, consistently showing no visual symptoms throughout the study. In contrast, certain lines, particularly those with similar pedigrees (entries 9-15), were highly susceptible, indicating a potential genetic basis for susceptibility.\n\nStatistical analyses revealed significant negative correlations between leafhopper injury ratings and seed yield, with coefficients of -0.49 in unprotected plots and -0.33 in protected plots in 1993. Additionally, a strong positive correlation (+0.87) was observed between yield and biomass, underscoring the importance of overall plant vigor in mitigating yield losses. The study also highlighted the variability in injury and yield responses across different years, attributed to fluctuating leafhopper populations and environmental conditions.\n\nThe findings underscore the economic significance of potato leafhopper infestations in dry bean production and the necessity for targeted pest management strategies. The research provides valuable insights for plant breeders, suggesting that incorporating resistance traits from cultivars like ‘Tacaragua’ and ‘Sierra’ could enhance the resilience of new bean varieties against leafhopper damage. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the need for ongoing research to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying leafhopper resistance and to develop integrated pest management practices that minimize reliance on chemical controls while maintaining crop yield stability."}

Bassett investigates the inheritance of novel flower and seedcoat patterns in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), focusing on two patterned parental lines, PI 390775 and ‘Springwater Half Runner’ (SHR), and a recurrent parent, the unpatterned Florida dry bean line 5-593. The research identifies two new genes, stp and stphbw, responsible for these traits.\n\nThrough a series of crosses involving F1, F2, backcross F2, and backcross F3 generations, the study demonstrates that a single recessive allele in each patterned parent controls the respective flower and seedcoat patterns. The recessive gene from PI 390775, designated as stp (for stippled seedcoat pattern), was shown to be nonallelic to the previously known genes C, T, and Mar, which are associated with seedcoat patterning. Conversely, the dominant gene from SHR, labeled stphbw (for half banner white), was confirmed to be allelic to stp, indicating that the stphbw allele exhibits dominance over stp.\n\nThe phenotypic analysis revealed that the F1 progeny from the cross PI 390775 x 5-593 exhibited bishops-violet flowers and unpatterned black seedcoats. In the F2 generation, the segregation of patterned versus unpatterned traits adhered to a 3:1 ratio, supporting the hypothesis of a single gene controlling the stippled seedcoat and flower color pattern. The study further confirmed the true breeding nature of the STP plants in subsequent F3 progeny tests.\n\nFor the SHR parent, the F1 progeny from the cross with 5-593 also displayed unpatterned flowers and seeds. The F2 generation again segregated in a 3:1 ratio for patterned versus unpatterned traits, reinforcing the single-gene hypothesis. The allelism tests conducted between the stp and stphbw genes confirmed that the stphbw allele is dominant, with the F2 progeny segregating into two phenotypic classes corresponding to the flower and seedcoat patterns of the SHR and PI 390775 parents.\n\nThe study employs various analytical methods, including progeny testing and chi-square analysis, to validate the genetic hypotheses. The findings contribute significantly to the understanding of genetic control over flower and seedcoat patterns in common bean, providing valuable insights for breeding programs aimed at enhancing aesthetic traits in beans. The identification of stp and stphbw as novel genetic markers opens avenues for further research into their functional roles and potential applications in plant breeding, particularly in developing varieties with desirable phenotypic traits."}

(1996) report the identification of a codominant RAPD marker (R2570/530) that is tightly linked to the recessive gene bgm-1, which confers partial resistance to Bean Golden Mosaic Virus (BGMV) in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). BGMV, a significant pathogen transmitted by whiteflies, poses a severe threat to bean production in tropical regions, particularly in Latin America and southern Florida. The bgm-1 gene, derived from the landrace cultivar Garrapato, provides a nonmosaic resistance response, making it a critical target for breeding programs aimed at enhancing disease resistance.\n\nThe authors utilized a bulked segregant analysis approach, screening 300 decamer primers to identify polymorphic RAPD fragments between DNA bulks of resistant and susceptible F6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The analysis revealed that the R2570/530 marker consists of two fragments: a 530-bp fragment linked in coupling with bgm-1 and a 570-bp fragment linked in repulsion. No recombinants were detected in a dry bean population of 91 F2 progeny, while two recombinants were found in a snap bean population of 48 F2 progeny, indicating a linkage distance of 4.2 cM for the latter.\n\nThe study emphasizes the utility of the R2570/530 marker for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programs, as it allows for the rapid introgression of bgm-1 into susceptible germplasm without the need for extensive field testing or greenhouse screening. The marker's gene-pool nonspecificity enhances its applicability across various common bean market classes, facilitating the breeding of BGMV-resistant cultivars.\n\nThe authors also discuss the implications of combining bgm-1 with other resistance genes to achieve higher levels of resistance and yield stability. They note that while bgm-1 provides partial resistance, it may not be sufficient under high disease pressure, underscoring the importance of pyramiding multiple resistance traits in breeding strategies.\n\nOverall, this research contributes significantly to the understanding of genetic resistance mechanisms against BGMV and provides a valuable tool for breeders aiming to enhance disease resistance in common bean. The identification of the R2570/530 marker represents a step forward in the application of molecular markers for improving crop resilience in the face of viral threats."}

Conducted at the University of Wisconsin–Madison during the summers of 1995 and 1996, the research aimed to estimate genetic variances and heritability associated with pod Ca concentration, which is crucial for enhancing nutritional value in human diets.\n\nThe experimental design employed an 8 × 8 double lattice, replicated across two years, with no additional Ca supplied to the sandy loam soil, which contained an average of 540 ppm Ca. Pod samples, specifically commercial sieve size no. 4 (8.3 to 9.5 mm in diameter), were analyzed for Ca concentration using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results indicated significant differences in pod Ca concentration among genotypes and years (P = 0.001), with concentrations ranging from 3.82 to 6.80 mg·g⁻¹ dry weight. Notably, several genotypes exceeded the best-performing commercial checks, suggesting potential for breeding programs.\n\nHeritability estimates for pod Ca concentration were calculated at 0.48 for CA2 and 0.50 for CA3, indicating a moderate genetic influence on this trait. The study found no significant differences between the two populations, and the year × genotype interaction was significant only in CA2, suggesting stable expression of pod Ca concentration across environments.\n\nThe research highlights the physiological basis of Ca accumulation, noting that Ca is immobile in the phloem and must be directly taken up by roots. Variability in pod Ca concentration among genotypes is likely attributed to differences in root pressure and Ca transport mechanisms. The findings align with previous studies indicating that breeding can effectively enhance Ca accumulation in snap beans, which are already recognized for their high bioavailability of Ca.\n\nOverall, this study underscores the importance of genetic selection in improving pod Ca concentration in snap beans, which could significantly contribute to human nutrition, particularly in regions with dietary Ca deficiencies. The results advocate for the integration of these genotypes into breeding programs aimed at increasing Ca levels in snap beans, thereby enhancing their nutritional value and economic significance as a food source."}

(1999), the genetic basis of resistance to bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) and bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was investigated using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between the pinto bean cultivars ‘Olathe’ (which carries the bc-u and bc-12 resistance genes) and ‘Sierra’ (which lacks known resistance genes). The research aimed to elucidate the inheritance patterns of resistance and to identify molecular markers linked to the resistance loci.\n\nThe authors assessed the resistance of 98 F5:6 RILs to BCMV strain NY15 and BCMNV strain NL-3 through visual symptom evaluation, virus titer measurement, and top dry weight analysis. The results indicated that 47 RILs exhibited moderate resistance to NL-3, while 51 were susceptible, fitting a 1:1 segregation ratio indicative of a single gene's influence. Conversely, for NY15, 29 RILs were resistant and 69 were susceptible, aligning with a 3:1 ratio suggestive of a two-gene model. The bc-12 gene was confirmed to confer moderate resistance to NL-3, either independently or in conjunction with bc-u.\n\nTo identify molecular markers associated with the resistance loci, the authors employed bulked segregant analysis using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. They discovered the OH141100 marker linked to the Bc-1 locus at a distance of 4.5 cM and the OC161000 marker linked to the Bc-u locus at 10.9 cM. Further analysis estimated a distance of 22.8 cM between the bc-12 and bc-u loci, indicating a loose linkage between these resistance genes.\n\nThe study also revisited previous findings by Drijfhout (1978), which suggested independence between bc-u and bc-12. The current findings challenge this notion, proposing that these genes are indeed linked, which has implications for breeding strategies aimed at enhancing BCMV resistance in common bean cultivars.\n\nThe research contributes to the understanding of the genetic architecture underlying viral resistance in common beans and highlights the potential for utilizing identified RAPD markers in breeding programs. The findings underscore the importance of combining resistance genes to achieve broad-spectrum resistance against BCMV and BCMNV, ultimately aiding in the development of resilient bean cultivars."}

The research utilized 78 F9 RI lines and employed random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, resulting in a linkage map spanning 755 cM with 90 markers, including 87 RAPD markers, one sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR), and the I gene for BCMV resistance.\n\nThe study revealed significant QTL for resistance to CBB and HB. Specifically, three QTL for leaf resistance to HB strain HB16 were identified on linkage groups (LG) 3, 5, and 10, while four QTL associated with leaf reactions to HB strain 83-Sc2A were located on LGs 2, 4, 5, and 9. Notably, the gene controlling the hypersensitive reaction to HB strain 83-Sc2A was mapped to LG 4, indicating a potential overlap with the QTL identified. The I locus, responsible for BCMV resistance, was mapped to LG 2, approximately 1.4 cM from the RAPD marker A10.1750.\n\nFor CBB resistance, five markers were significantly associated with leaf reactions, with the marker W10.550 on LG 10 accounting for 44% of the phenotypic variation in leaf resistance and 41% in pod resistance. This suggests a strong genetic basis for resistance traits, which could be leveraged in breeding programs. The study also highlighted the presence of common QTL for resistance in both leaves and pods, indicating potential for pyramiding resistance genes.\n\nThe authors emphasized the importance of utilizing molecular markers linked to disease resistance genes for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programs, particularly as genetic resistance is the most effective strategy for managing these diseases. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of disease resistance in common beans and provide a framework for future research aimed at enhancing resistance through breeding strategies.

{"doi": "10.21273_JASHS.124.6.663", "summary": "In this study, Bassett et al. investigate the genetic basis of partly colored seedcoats in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and propose a new allele, designated as tcf, at the T locus. The research builds on previous findings that suggested the involvement of two complementary genes (Fcr and Fcr-2) in the expression of seedcoat color and flower color restoration, but the current results challenge this hypothesis.\n\nThe authors derived genetic tester stocks from the Plant Introduction (PI) accession 507984, which exhibited partly colored seeds and colored flowers, and crossed these with the Florida dry bean breeding line 5-593, characterized by black self-colored seeds and purple flowers. The F2 populations from these crosses consistently displayed colored flowers, contradicting earlier assumptions that the t allele would lead to white flowers when combined with Fcr and Fcr-2. Instead, the data suggest that the tcf allele can produce partly colored seedcoats without affecting flower color.\n\nTo elucidate the genetic linkage, the authors employed a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker, OM19400, which is linked in repulsion to the T gene. Analysis of F2 populations revealed that the tcf allele is either an allele at the T locus or closely linked to it, as evidenced by the segregation patterns observed. The study's findings indicate that the tcf allele is dominant over the recessive t allele, leading to the expression of partly colored seeds while maintaining colored flowers.\n\nThe research also highlights the significance of the genetic background in determining seedcoat patterns. The authors suggest that the presence of the OM19400 marker in both t and tcf backgrounds indicates a shared ancestral lineage, further supporting the hypothesis that tcf is a derived allele from T. The study proposes that the genetic control of seedcoat color is more complex than previously understood, involving additional unidentified loci that may influence the expression of seedcoat patterns.\n\nOverall, this research contributes to the understanding of seedcoat genetics in common bean, providing insights that could inform breeding programs aimed at enhancing seedcoat color diversity. The identification of the tcf allele opens new avenues for exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying seedcoat pigmentation and its potential applications in bean breeding for aesthetic and market value.

(2000) investigate the chemical and morphological expression of the B and Asp seedcoat genes in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), focusing on their roles in anthocyanin biosynthesis and seedcoat characteristics. The research analyzes three genotypes differing by single substitutions at the seedcoat locus: Florida common bean breeding line 5-593 (P C J G B V Asp), matte black (P C J G B V asp), and dark brown violet (P C J G b V Asp). \n\nThe primary anthocyanins identified in the seedcoats are delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, petunidin 3-O-glucoside, and malvidin 3-O-glucoside. Quantitative analysis via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) reveals significant differences in anthocyanin concentrations among the genotypes, with dark brown violet exhibiting only 19% of the total anthocyanin content found in 5-593. This suggests that the B gene regulates anthocyanin levels quantitatively rather than qualitatively, likely influencing precursor availability in the biosynthetic pathway.\n\nThe study hypothesizes that the B gene may act at the chalcone synthase or chalcone isomerase steps, regulating both flavonoid (color) and isoflavonoid (resistance) pathways. The I gene, closely linked to B, is implicated in resistance to bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) through its role in enhancing phytoalexin production, specifically phaseollin, in response to viral infection. The authors propose that the B and I genes may be allelic or functionally related, controlling similar biosynthetic pathways.\n\nThe Asp gene, while not directly involved in color determination, affects seedcoat glossiness by altering the morphology of palisade cells in the seedcoat epidermis. The recessive asp allele results in smaller palisade cells, leading to a duller seedcoat and reduced anthocyanin accumulation. Scanning electron microscopy confirms these morphological changes, showing differences in cell size and surface texture among the genotypes.\n\nThe research employs a robust analytical framework, including HPLC-DAD and NMR spectroscopy, to characterize anthocyanin structures and concentrations. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms underlying seedcoat color and glossiness in common beans, with implications for breeding strategies aimed at enhancing nutritional quality and disease resistance. Future research is suggested to further elucidate the regulatory roles of the B and I genes in isoflavonoid biosynthesis and their potential allelic relationship."}

The authors confirm the seedcoat genotype of ‘Wagenaar’ as C J g b vlae Rk and propose a new gene symbol, gy, to denote the recessive gene responsible for the SGY phenotype. The research employs classical genetic methods alongside molecular techniques, specifically the development of three RAPD markers (OAP7850, OAP31400, and OU14950) linked to the G locus, which is known to influence seedcoat color.\n\nThe study reveals that the SGY phenotype does not segregate with the G locus, as demonstrated through F2 populations derived from crosses between ‘Wagenaar’ and a genetic tester stock (g b v BC3 5-593). The segregation ratio of 3:1 for pale greenish-yellow (PGY) to SGY in the F2 population supports the hypothesis that SGY is controlled by a single recessive gene (gy). Further analysis of F3 progenies confirmed this, with true breeding SGY plants observed.\n\nThe authors also explore the seedcoat genotype of ‘Enola’, which is determined to be C J g b vlae Rk gy, indicating that it shares the gy gene with ‘Wagenaar’. The relationship between ‘Enola’ and the ‘Mayocoba’ market class is discussed, suggesting that both cultivars exhibit the SGY trait with variable expressivity, influenced by environmental conditions during growth.\n\nThe study employs various analytical methods, including the Munsell Book of Color and a Minolta Chroma Meter, to characterize the SGY seedcoat color quantitatively. The results indicate that the SGY color is not only distinct but also exhibits variability in expression depending on environmental factors, which is typical for traits governed by recessive alleles.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for plant breeding, particularly in the context of developing new cultivars with desirable seedcoat colors. The identification of the gy gene provides a genetic marker that can be utilized in breeding programs aimed at enhancing the aesthetic and market value of common beans. Additionally, the research challenges the claims made in the patent for ‘Enola’, asserting that the SGY color is not unique to this cultivar but is also present in other established varieties, including ‘Wagenaar’ and ‘Mayocoba’.\n\nOverall, this study contributes to the understanding of seedcoat color genetics in common beans, elucidating the inheritance patterns and molecular basis of the SGY phenotype, while also addressing broader implications for breeding strategies and cultivar development in the legume market."}

The allelic relationships were tested using the L gene from the cultivar ‘Thuringia’ and the lers gene from ‘Early Wax’, revealing that L is identical to j, while lers represents a distinct allele at the same locus.\n\nThe study introduces a novel seedcoat pattern termed \"reverse margo,\" determined by the genotype T/t z/z j/jers within a specific genetic background. The authors developed a RAPD marker (OL4525) linked to the j gene, estimating a linkage distance of 1.2 cM, and a distance of 4.7 cM for the jers allele.

(2002) investigates the genetic control of raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs)—specifically raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose—in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), which are known to affect digestibility and contribute to flatulence. The research employs a diallel mating design involving eight landraces selected for high and low sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose content to analyze the inheritance patterns of these oligosaccharides.\n\nRFOs are critical for seed desiccation tolerance and germination, particularly in cold, wet soils. The study reveals that while low levels of RFOs are nutritionally desirable, higher levels may enhance seed performance under specific conditions. The authors utilized gas-liquid chromatography to quantify soluble sugars, detecting fructose, sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose in the bean seeds. The F1 generation exhibited a range of sugar concentrations, with fructose (0.1 to 2.5 mg/g dry weight), sucrose (17.2 to 56.5 mg/g), raffinose (0.1 to 4.1 mg/g), and stachyose (7.6 to 43.7 mg/g).\n\nGriffing’s analysis indicated that general combining ability (GCA) effects were significantly greater than specific combining ability (SCA) effects, suggesting that additive genetic variance predominates in the inheritance of RFOs. The average narrow-sense heritability estimates for sucrose, raffinose, stachyose, total sugar, and total oligosaccharides were 0.22, 0.54, 0.44, 0.17, and 0.27, respectively, indicating moderate heritability and the potential for selective breeding.\n\nReciprocal differences were noted in the F1 and F2 generations, attributed to maternal effects influencing RFO accumulation, but these effects diminished in the F3 generation. Hayman’s analysis confirmed partial dominance in RFO accumulation, with significant GCA effects for all sugars across generations. The study identifies specific parental lines with favorable GCA effects for breeding purposes, such as G13817 for sucrose and PUE 40 for raffinose.\n\nThe findings underscore the genetic complexity of RFO biosynthesis, suggesting that manipulation of RFO levels in common bean is feasible through selective breeding strategies. The authors propose that the accumulation of RFOs may be controlled by a common mechanism involving galactinol synthase and galactinol:raffinose-6-galactosyltransferase, with implications for breeding beans with optimized oligosaccharide profiles for both nutritional quality and agronomic performance.\n\nThis research contributes to the understanding of RFO genetic control in common beans, highlighting the potential for breeding programs aimed at improving digestibility and seed performance under stress conditions."}

The second QTL on LG2, linked to four markers, appeared to derive from the California parents, indicating potential for unexpected sources of desirable traits in breeding programs.\n\nThe QTL on LG1 explained approximately 7% to 9% of the variance in APP and SPLT in Population 1, while the QTL on LG2 accounted for 5% to 7% of the variance in both traits in Population 2. Notably, the study found that alleles from cultivars typically considered inferior for canning quality could contribute positively to these traits, highlighting the complexity of genetic contributions to canning quality.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programs aimed at improving canning quality in kidney beans. The identified markers, particularly OP15.1150 on LG1 and OG17.1300 on LG2, could facilitate early selection for desirable traits, potentially streamlining breeding efforts. This research contributes valuable insights into the genetic basis of canning quality in kidney beans and suggests avenues for further exploration in enhancing these traits through breeding strategies."}
{"doi": "10.21273_JASHS.128.4.0559", "summary": "In this study, Mark J. Bassett investigates the inheritance of flower color and seedcoat color in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) through an interspecific cross with scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus). The primary focus is on the genetic mechanisms underlying the expression of scarlet flower color and oxblood red seedcoat color, which are influenced by the genes Sal and Am, respectively.\n\nThe study begins by establishing that the gene Sal is essential for the expression of salmon red flower color, while the gene Am is responsible for the transition from salmon red to scarlet. The research utilized the Lamprecht line M0169, which expresses salmon red flowers with a vein pattern and black seedcoats, crossed with the Florida dry bean line 5-593, which has white flowers and mineral brown seedcoats. The F2 progeny from these crosses demonstrated that Am is a partly dominant gene that modifies the expression of Sal, with the absence of Sal resulting in no expression of Am.\n\nProgeny tests revealed that Am is linked to the vein pattern gene (V) with a genetic distance of approximately 9.4 cM, and a dominant gene, tentatively named Oxb, which influences the transition from mineral brown seedcoats to oxblood red. The study proposes that the Am gene has pleiotropic effects, altering both flower color and vein pattern expression. Specifically, the genotype Sal/Sal Am/Am results in scarlet flowers devoid of vein patterns, while Sal/Sal Am/am can express either scarlet or intermediate red flowers, depending on the presence of vein patterns.\n\nThe research also highlights the complex inheritance of seedcoat color, where the oxblood red phenotype appears to be controlled by Oxb, closely linked to Am. The findings suggest that the expression of oxblood red seedcoat color may be a result of augmented expression of the red haze phenotype associated with Sal, rather than a separate genetic trait.\n\nAnalytical methods included chi-square tests for segregation ratios, which supported the proposed genetic models. The study concludes that the interactions between Sal and Am are critical for understanding flower color variation in beans, and the linkage between Am and Oxb provides insights into seedcoat color inheritance. This research contributes to the genetic understanding of color traits in beans, which has implications for breeding programs aimed at enhancing aesthetic and marketable qualities in common bean cultivars."}

(2004) investigate the seedling emergence of 180 common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) accessions under suboptimal temperature conditions, specifically focusing on the challenges posed by low seedbed temperatures during early spring planting in Saskatchewan, Canada. The research aims to identify accessions with superior emergence capabilities that could be utilized in breeding programs to enhance early planting strategies and mitigate the risks associated with late spring frosts.\n\nField trials were conducted over two growing seasons (2000 and 2001), with soil temperatures recorded between 1-18 °C in 2000 and 5-17 °C in 2001. The study assessed percent emergence at multiple time points (20, 30, 40, and 50 days post-planting), cumulative thermal units (CTUs) to 50% anthesis and maturity, and seed yield. Notably, the navy bean accession G8823 demonstrated significantly higher emergence rates compared to control cultivars at 20 days after planting in 2000 and maintained competitive emergence levels in 2001, indicating its potential as a parent for breeding programs aimed at developing cultivars with enhanced cold tolerance.\n\nThe results revealed that G8823 and G9345 exhibited superior emergence under suboptimal temperatures, with G8823 consistently achieving 30% emergence in 2000 and 25% in 2001. In contrast, accessions such as G746 and UI 906 showed delayed emergence, with significant increases only observed after soil temperatures rose. The study also highlighted the importance of seed quality and viability, as well as the potential impact of soil moisture on emergence rates.\n\nCumulative thermal units to 50% anthesis varied among accessions, with G8823 requiring fewer CTUs than control cultivars, suggesting a faster development rate. The findings indicate that accessions can be categorized based on their emergence response: those with rapid emergence, those with delayed emergence, and those with poor emergence under cold conditions. The authors emphasize the need for further research to explore the relationship between early stand establishment, maturity, and yield, particularly in the context of breeding strategies for northern climates.\n\nThis research contributes valuable insights into the genetic diversity of common bean accessions regarding their emergence under low-temperature stress, providing a foundation for breeding efforts aimed at improving resilience to abiotic stresses in bean production systems. The identification of G8823 as a promising candidate for breeding programs underscores the potential for enhancing early planting strategies and optimizing yield in regions with short growing seasons."}

The genotypes included 12 snap beans, two wax beans, six dry beans, and four common bean accessions, with 18 previously identified as heat-tolerant and three as heat-sensitive controls. The experimental design involved four temperature treatments (24 °C/21 °C, 27 °C/24 °C, 30 °C/27 °C, and 33 °C/30 °C) applied during the critical reproductive phase.\n\nResults indicated that exposure to the highest temperature treatment (T4) significantly reduced yield components: seed number, pod number, mean seed weight, and seeds per pod decreased by an average of 83%, 63%, 47%, and 73%, respectively. A heat susceptibility index (S) was calculated to assess yield stability under heat stress, revealing that genotypes such as ‘Brio’, ‘Carson’, ‘G122’, ‘HB 1880’, ‘HT 20’, ‘HT 38’, ‘Opus’, and ‘Venture’ exhibited heat tolerance, while others like ‘Haibushi’, ‘Indeterminate Jamaica Red’, and ‘Tío Canela-75’ displayed unexpected heat sensitivity.\n\nThe study highlighted that high night temperatures are particularly detrimental to reproductive development, with microsporogenesis identified as the most sensitive stage. The authors noted a correlation between high temperatures and reduced pollen viability, leading to decreased seed set and increased abscission of reproductive organs, particularly flowers and young pods. This aligns with previous findings that high temperatures can induce morphological abnormalities in pollen and anthers, ultimately affecting yield.\n\nThe experimental design employed a randomized block approach with four replications, ensuring uniformity in temperature and humidity across treatments. Data collection focused on pod and seed counts, seed weight, and visual assessments of reproductive organ abscission. Statistical analysis confirmed significant interactions between genotype and temperature treatment, underscoring the genetic variability in heat tolerance among the evaluated genotypes.\n\nThe findings suggest that the optimal temperature regime for screening common bean materials for heat tolerance is around 30 °C/27 °C (T3), where moderate heat tolerance was observed. The study emphasizes the importance of identifying and utilizing nonallelic heat tolerance genes in breeding programs to enhance the resilience of common beans to high-temperature environments, particularly in regions experiencing seasonal heat waves or in tropical climates.\n\nOverall, this research contributes valuable insights into the genetic basis of heat tolerance in common beans, providing a foundation for future breeding efforts aimed at improving yield stability and expanding the geographic range of cultivation in the face of climate change."}

Bassett investigates the inheritance of a novel two-points seedcoat pattern in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), derived from the Plant Introduction (PI) accession 507984. The gene responsible for this pattern, designated as tcf, is shown to interact with other alleles at the T locus, specifically z jers, to produce the distinctive seedcoat phenotype characterized by two distinct colored dots at the micropyle.\n\nThe research utilized a genetic tester stock, tcf two-points BC3 5-593, which was developed through backcrossing PI 507984 with the Florida dry bean breeding line 5-593. This line exhibits black self-colored seeds and purple flowers due to its T P V genotype. The study involved a series of test crosses with three genetic tester stocks: t z jers white, t z bip bipunctata, and t z virgarcus, analyzing F1, F2, and F3 progeny for segregation patterns of flower color and seedcoat patterns.\n\nKey findings indicate that the two-points pattern can only manifest in the presence of the tcf z jers genotype. The F1 progeny from the cross tcf two-points BC3 5-593 × t z jers white exhibited nearly white seedcoats, confirming the hypothesis that tcf is necessary for the expression of the two-points pattern. The F2 generation segregated into two phenotypic classes: 27 plants with the two-points pattern (tcf/tcf z jers) and 42 nearly white plants (tcf/t z jers), supporting the dominance of tcf for flower color while exhibiting weak dominance for seedcoat pattern.\n\nThe study also elucidates the genetic interactions at the T locus, where the t allele exhibits pleiotropic effects, leading to both partly colored seedcoats and white flowers. The results suggest that the tcf allele allows for greater expansion of colored zones in seedcoats compared to the t allele, as evidenced by the observed phenotypic classes and their segregation ratios, which fit expected Mendelian ratios.\n\nAnalytical methods included chi-square tests to assess segregation ratios, confirming the genetic hypothesis for the two-points pattern. The research highlights the complexity of seedcoat color inheritance in common beans and suggests that the genotype at the Z locus in PI 507984 remains uncertain, warranting further investigation.\n\nThis study contributes to the understanding of seedcoat genetics in common beans and has implications for breeding programs aimed at developing varieties with specific seedcoat patterns, which may enhance marketability and consumer preference.

Bassett investigates the inheritance of the Intensified Anthocyanin Expression (IAE) syndrome in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), focusing on a new gene designated as Prpi-2. The research utilizes a selection from the CIAT accession line G07262, characterized by white flowers with blue veins and a distinctive seedcoat pattern. The inheritance patterns were analyzed through crosses with various genetic tester stocks, including Florida dry bean line 5-593, which has a known genotype of T P [C r] Z J G B V Rk.\n\nThe findings reveal that G07262 possesses the genotype t pmic V, where the t allele suppresses the expression of IAE syndrome, which is dominantly expressed only when the T allele is present. The study demonstrates that Prpi-2 is responsible for the IAE syndrome, as evidenced by the expression of intense purple flowers and pods in F1 progeny from crosses involving G07262. The data suggest that the expression of IAE is epistatically suppressed by the t allele, and that Prpi-2 operates independently of the C locus, which is traditionally associated with seedcoat color.\n\nThe research also reconciles historical gene symbols related to purple pod and IAE syndrome traits, clarifying the complexities of previous classifications. The study identifies two novel two-colored seedcoat patterns that have not been previously reported, indicating a trigenic interaction involving Prpi-2, C, and other loci. The segregation ratios observed in F2 progeny fit expected Mendelian ratios, supporting the hypothesis of a dominant gene for IAE syndrome carried by G07262.\n\nAnalytical methods employed include phenotypic segregation analysis in F1 and F2 progeny, which revealed significant insights into the genetic interactions governing flower and seedcoat color. The study proposes that Prpi-2 may represent either a new allele at the complex C locus or an independent gene, warranting further investigation into its origin and functional mechanisms.\n\nOverall, this research contributes to the understanding of anthocyanin biosynthesis in common beans, with implications for plant breeding strategies aimed at enhancing desirable traits such as flower and pod coloration.

{"doi": "10.21273_JASHS.132.3.352", "summary": "In the study by Bassett and Miklas (2007), a new gene designated as **bic** was identified in common bean (*Phaseolus vulgaris*) that exhibits pleiotropic effects on flower and seed coat coloration. The gene was derived from the bicolor flower trait of the *Phaseolus coccineus* variety ‘Painted Lady’, characterized by vermilion banner petals and white wing petals. The inheritance of this trait was investigated through backcrossing and allelism tests with established genetic stocks.\n\nThe research demonstrated that the bicolor flower and dark olive brown seed coat traits are controlled by a single recessive gene, **bic**, which acts independently of other known genes affecting flower and seed coat color, specifically the **T**, **P**, **V**, and **Wb** loci. The allelism tests confirmed that **bic** does not interact with these loci, supporting the hypothesis of pleiotropy where one gene influences multiple phenotypic traits.\n\nThe experimental design involved crossing a pure line (line 33) exhibiting the bicolor flower and dark olive brown seed coat with a line (5-593) that has a black seed coat and no flower pattern. The F2 and F3 progenies from this cross segregated in a 3:1 ratio for flower and seed coat color, consistent with Mendelian inheritance patterns. Further testing across multiple genetic tester stocks confirmed the independence of **bic** from other color-modifying genes.\n\nThe study also provided a comprehensive overview of the genetic architecture of flower and seed coat color in common beans, highlighting the complexity of these traits and the interactions among various alleles. The findings contribute to the understanding of genetic diversity in common beans and have implications for breeding programs aimed at enhancing aesthetic and nutritional qualities of the crop.\n\nKey analytical methods employed included segregation analysis and chi-square tests to evaluate the fit of observed phenotypic ratios to expected Mendelian ratios. The results indicated that the **bic** gene is a distinct locus, potentially offering new avenues for breeding strategies focused on flower and seed coat traits in common beans.\n\nOverall, the identification of the **bic** gene enriches the genetic framework of common bean breeding, providing a valuable tool for developing varieties with desirable flower and seed coat characteristics. Further research is suggested to explore the functional mechanisms of **bic** and its potential applications in enhancing the visual appeal and marketability of common beans."}

CBB is a significant seed-borne disease that leads to substantial yield losses, particularly under high-temperature conditions.\n\nThe research focuses on two sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, SU91 and BC420, linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with CBB resistance. Field experiments conducted in East Lansing and Saginaw, Michigan, revealed that the presence of the SU91 marker correlated with reduced CBB leaf and pod disease ratings (r = –0.50 to –0.59) and was associated with lower yield in one location (r = –0.20). The study also explored the interaction between these markers, finding that combining SU91 and BC420 did not enhance resistance beyond that provided by either marker alone, suggesting potential epistatic interactions.\n\nThe authors developed F2 populations from resistant parents derived from the breeding line VAX 5, which incorporates resistance from both *P. vulgaris* and *P. acutifolius*. The study utilized marker-assisted selection (MAS) to streamline the breeding process, allowing for the identification of resistant genotypes without extensive phenotypic screening. The results indicated that while SU91 was significantly associated with CBB resistance, it also exhibited a weak correlation with yield reduction, raising concerns about linkage drag.\n\nThe findings underscore the complexity of breeding for CBB resistance, as the trait is quantitatively inherited and influenced by environmental factors. The study emphasizes the potential of MAS to facilitate the development of high-yielding, CBB-resistant cultivars, although it also highlights the need for careful evaluation of marker-trait associations across different genetic backgrounds.\n\nOverall, this research contributes to the understanding of CBB resistance in common beans and demonstrates the utility of molecular markers in breeding programs aimed at improving disease resistance while maintaining agronomic performance. The study advocates for the pyramiding of multiple QTL to enhance resistance levels, suggesting that further exploration of genetic interactions and marker efficiency in diverse populations is warranted."}

The research aimed to enhance the genetic understanding of traits critical for snap bean processing and consumer preferences, including pod wall fiber, pod dimensions, and seed color.\n\nThe RR138 population was genotyped using the BARCBean6K_3 Beadchip, resulting in a linkage map comprising 1689 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 1196 cM, with an average density of one SNP per 1.4 cM. Notably, the study identified significant QTL for various traits: a QTL for the string:pod length (PL) ratio on Pv02 accounted for 32% of the genetic variation, while clusters of QTL for pod wall fiber, pod height, pod width, and pod wall thickness on Pv04 explained 21%, 26%, 18%, and 16% of the variation, respectively. Additionally, a QTL for PL on Pv09 controlled 5% of the variation.\n\nThe study also confirmed the locations of the seed color genes B and P, with B mapped to Pv02 and P to Pv07. The findings suggest that the genetic control of pod traits is complex, with evidence of transgressive segregation observed in the progeny, indicating potential for developing superior cultivars through targeted breeding strategies.

OTA is predominantly associated with cereals, but its presence in a wide range of foods necessitates stringent regulatory measures, especially in the European Union.\n\nHistorically, OTA was first identified in Aspergillus ochraceus, with Penicillium verrucosum also recognized as a producer. Recent molecular techniques have revealed a broader spectrum of OTA-producing species within the black aspergilli, yet only a few are confirmed as significant contaminants in food. The authors highlight the taxonomic complexities of this group, noting that morphological identification is often insufficient due to subtle phenotypic variations among species. Consequently, a polyphasic approach combining morphological, molecular (e.g., ITS, β-tubulin, and calmodulin gene sequencing), and extrolite profiling is recommended for accurate species identification.\n\nAmong the black aspergilli, A. niger and A. welwitschiae are noted as common OTA producers, with A. carbonarius identified as the primary source of OTA in wine and dried vine fruits. A. niger, while widely utilized in biotechnology, has been shown to produce OTA under certain conditions, raising concerns about its safety in food production. The review also discusses the lesser-known A. lacticoffeatus, which produces OTA and is characterized by its distinctive colony coloration.\n\nThe authors emphasize the need for systematic surveys to ascertain the sources of OTA contamination in various food products, including coffee, cocoa, and spices. They note that while A. niger is frequently isolated from spices and liquorice, the specific sources of OTA in these products remain largely unidentified. The review calls for improved detection methods, such as HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry, to confirm OTA production and enhance the identification of mycotoxigenic fungi.\n\nIn conclusion, the review underscores the importance of understanding the diversity and ecological roles of black aspergilli in food systems, as well as the need for ongoing research to clarify the contributions of various species to OTA contamination. This knowledge is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate the risks associated with OTA in food safety and public health."}

(2022) conducted a study evaluating the physicochemical properties, in vitro dry matter digestibility, and apparent nitrogen digestibility in fecal matter and urine of pigs fed an extruded diet incorporating common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) as a substitute for soybean meal. The study aimed to standardize the extrusion process for two formulations of bean flour (Pinto Saltillo), corn flour (Cafime), and soybean meal at varying proportions (20/67/13% and 30/60/10%).\n\nThe extrusion process was optimized at temperatures between 120-150°C and moisture contents of 18-22%. Key physicochemical properties assessed included expansion index (EI), bulk density (BD), water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), hardness, water activity, and color parameters (L*, a*, b*). The optimal conditions for the 20% bean flour formulation were identified as 124.4°C and 18.59% moisture content. Results indicated that higher extrusion temperatures reduced BD, hardness, and water activity while increasing EI and L* values. Conversely, increased moisture content decreased BD, water activity, hardness, and a* values.\n\nIn vitro dry matter digestibility was significantly higher for the extruded bean diet (92.33%) compared to the control diet (85.33%), suggesting that the thermal treatment effectively reduced anti-nutritional factors in common beans, enhancing nutrient availability. Apparent nitrogen digestibility in fecal matter was lower for the extruded diet, while nitrogen digestibility in urine was higher compared to the control.\n\nThe study concluded that common bean flour is a viable alternative protein source for pig diets, offering comparable nutritional value and digestibility to conventional feeds. The findings support the potential of using extruded common beans in animal nutrition, particularly in reducing reliance on soybean meal, thus contributing to more sustainable livestock production practices.\n\nThis research highlights the importance of optimizing extrusion parameters to enhance the nutritional profile of animal feeds, and it opens avenues for further investigation into the use of alternative protein sources in monogastric diets.

The research highlights the nutritional significance of these foods, which are rich in dietary fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and phytochemicals, including phenolic compounds and flavonoids.\n\nThe methodology involved grinding both raw and roasted samples into powder, followed by extraction with 70% methanol. The extracts were analyzed for antioxidant activity using the DPPH and ABTS assays, and for total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with a significance threshold of p < 0.05.\n\nResults indicated a general trend of increasing antioxidant activity from CN to WN among nuts and from CB to MB among beans in raw samples. Specifically, the DPPH scavenging activity was lowest in raw CB (16.87%) and highest in raw WN (91.35%). Roasting significantly affected antioxidant capacities; for instance, roasted CN and CB exhibited increased DPPH and ABTS activities, while AN, WN, and MB showed decreased activities post-roasting. The TPC increased in roasted CN, AN, GB, and CB, but decreased in WN, indicating that roasting can enhance certain bioactive compounds while degrading others.\n\nThe study also noted that the TFC levels varied, with raw MB showing the highest flavonoid content (5.61 mg/g) and roasted AN exhibiting the lowest (1.37 mg/g). The authors suggest that the roasting process may lead to both the degradation of heat-sensitive antioxidants and the formation of new antioxidant compounds through the Maillard reaction, which could explain the observed increases in antioxidant activity for some samples.\n\nOverall, the findings underscore the dual nature of roasting as a method that can enhance or diminish the nutritional value of dry beans and nuts. The study emphasizes the importance of these foods as sources of natural antioxidants, advocating for their inclusion in a balanced diet to mitigate oxidative stress-related diseases. The results contribute to the understanding of how processing methods can influence the health benefits of plant-based foods, providing valuable insights for consumers and food manufacturers alike."}

The presence of U. plantaginea negatively impacted several morphological traits of the bean cultivars, including leaf area, dry matter, stem diameter, and plant height, suggesting that alexandergrass possesses superior competitive ability for resources such as light, water, and nutrients.\n\nNotably, at the 10:10 plant ratio, both cultivars demonstrated higher relative growth compared to U. plantaginea, as indicated by relative competition indices, relative clustering coefficients, and aggressiveness metrics. Intraspecific competition was found to be more detrimental than interspecific competition for both species, highlighting the complexities of plant interactions in mixed cropping systems.\n\nPhysiological assessments revealed that the photosynthetic rate (A) of U. plantaginea increased with its proportion in the mixtures, while the cultivar SCS Predileto experienced a decline in A at higher weed densities. Conversely, BRS Campeiro maintained a higher photosynthetic rate under competitive conditions. The study also measured stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), and internal CO2 concentration (Ci), which collectively indicated that competition for resources led to biochemical limitations in photosynthesis for both bean cultivars.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of selecting competitive cultivars in bean breeding programs to enhance crop resilience against weed interference. The findings suggest that effective weed management strategies, including the use of competitive bean cultivars, can mitigate the adverse effects of U. plantaginea, ultimately improving bean productivity. This study contributes valuable insights into the dynamics of crop-weed competition and the potential for breeding more competitive bean varieties in agricultural systems."}

The research focused on identifying breeding lines carrying known resistance genes, particularly the dominant I gene and the recessive bc-1² and bc-2² genes.\n\nThe experimental design involved mechanical sap-inoculation of breeding lines with BCMNV NL-3 and BCMV NL-4 strains, followed by a 21-day evaluation period for symptomatic responses. The results indicated that 153 lines exhibited resistance to BCMV NL-4, while five lines showed resistance to BCMNV NL-3. The presence of the dominant I gene was confirmed in these lines, while four lines were identified to possess the recessive bc-1² gene and five lines the bc-2² gene. Notably, the dominant I gene was effective against most BCMV strains, although some necrosis-inducing strains could elicit a hypersensitive response at elevated temperatures.\n\nMolecular analysis utilized sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers linked to resistance genes. The SW-13 marker, associated with the I gene, successfully identified 133 of the 153 resistant lines, yielding an 87% success rate. However, the SBD-5 marker, linked to the bc-1² gene, produced erroneous results in many lines, highlighting the need for caution in relying solely on molecular markers for resistance gene identification.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of combining phenotypic evaluations with molecular techniques to accurately assess resistance. The identified resistant breeding lines are proposed as potential candidates for registration as new cultivars and could serve as valuable sources of germplasm for future breeding programs aimed at enhancing virus resistance in common bean. The findings contribute to the understanding of genetic resistance mechanisms in common bean and underscore the potential for developing more resilient cultivars through strategic breeding practices.\n\nOverall, this research provides critical insights into the genetic basis of resistance to BCMV and BCMNV, offering a pathway for improving the resilience of common bean against these economically damaging viruses. The integration of molecular markers in breeding programs is recommended to facilitate the selection of desirable gene combinations, ultimately leading to enhanced crop performance and stability in the face of viral threats."}

The reduction in visible injury was most pronounced at 14 days after application (DAA), with seed treatment yielding a 42% reduction in injuries for the BRS-Esplendor cultivar when treated with fluazifop-P + fomesafen. The electron transport rate (ETR) of photosystem II was also protected by naphthalic anhydride, maintaining levels similar to the control without herbicide application, indicating that the safener mitigated herbicide-induced stress.\n\nThe study highlights the role of naphthalic anhydride in enhancing the activity of detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and cytochrome P-450, which are implicated in the metabolic degradation of herbicides. This enzymatic activity likely contributes to the observed reduction in phytotoxicity and the maintenance of plant biomass, as evidenced by the lack of significant reductions in dry weight for plants treated with naphthalic anhydride compared to controls.\n\nThe findings suggest that naphthalic anhydride can effectively increase the selectivity of herbicides in common bean crops, particularly for the tested cultivars.

The research emphasizes the inadequacy of existing resistance, primarily conferred by the dominant I gene against the bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), as BCMNV has shown the ability to overcome this resistance.\n\nThe authors screened 40 bean genotypes, including commercial snap bean cultivars, landraces, breeding lines, and resistant checks, under both field and greenhouse conditions. The results indicated that most snap bean cultivars were susceptible to BCMNV, exhibiting symptoms such as top necrosis, mosaics, mottling, and stunted growth. The presence of BCMNV was confirmed through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which also detected asymptomatic infections.\n\nMolecular analysis utilized specific markers to assess the presence of resistance genes. The SW13 marker confirmed the presence of the dominant I gene, while the elF4E marker was linked to the recessive bc-3 gene. Notably, the resistant checks (MCM 1015, MCM 2001, and MCM 5001) did not exhibit symptoms, indicating their potential as sources of resistance for breeding programs. The ROC11 marker, associated with the bc-3 gene, was present in all snap bean genotypes except the resistant checks, suggesting that the latter carry this gene.\n\nThe study classified BCMNV isolates into pathotypes III and VI, correlating with the observed symptoms and confirming the need for further characterization of viral strains affecting bean crops in Kenya. The authors highlight the importance of combining the I gene with recessive genes like bc-3 to achieve durable resistance against both BCMV and BCMNV, as these genes operate through different mechanisms.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of using molecular markers in marker-assisted selection (MAS) to enhance breeding efforts for BCMNV resistance. The study advocates for the incorporation of resistant dry bean cultivars into breeding programs to develop snap bean varieties with improved resistance profiles. Furthermore, the authors call for the identification of additional molecular markers for other recessive resistance genes to broaden the genetic basis for resistance in snap beans.\n\nIn conclusion, this research provides critical insights into the current state of BCMNV resistance in snap beans in Kenya, emphasizing the necessity for integrated breeding strategies that leverage both dominant and recessive resistance genes to combat viral threats effectively."}

The research was conducted at two agricultural sites in Latvia, where seeds were inoculated with rhizobia before sowing. Plant samples were collected at flowering and harvest stages, and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and elemental analysis (EA) to quantify macro- and micro-nutrient concentrations.\n\nResults indicated that rhizobial inoculation significantly influenced the uptake of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), and zinc (Zn). In faba bean leaves, notable increases were observed in Na (38.8%), Mg (10.3%), and Ca (12%), while P and K concentrations decreased in seeds. For soybeans, increases in Mg (8.2%), Ca (21.9%), and Zn (20%) were recorded in leaves, but reductions in N, P, K, and Fe concentrations were noted in seeds and stems.\n\nThe study highlights that the symbiotic relationship with rhizobia not only enhances nitrogen fixation but also alters the concentrations of other essential nutrients, which can affect plant growth and yield. Specifically, the inoculation led to a marked increase in mineral element concentrations in the vegetative parts of both legumes, suggesting improved photosynthetic activity. However, the decrease in certain nutrients in seeds indicates a potential trade-off between nitrogen fixation and nutrient accumulation in reproductive tissues.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of rhizobial inoculation as a sustainable agricultural practice that can reduce reliance on nitrogen fertilizers while enhancing the nutritional quality of legumes. The study suggests that while rhizobial strains can improve the overall nutrient profile of legume leaves, additional mineral fertilization may be necessary to optimize seed nutrient content, ensuring the production of nutrient-rich food products. This research contributes to the understanding of legume-rhizobia interactions and their implications for agricultural practices aimed at improving crop yield and nutritional value."}

The research addresses the persistent low yields of common beans in the region, attributed to suboptimal agronomic practices and environmental factors.\n\nThe field experiment utilized a randomized complete block design with four replications, assessing four fertilization treatments: Bulk blend (30-10-12), Nitrofoska Triple 16, organic blend, and urea. Key findings indicate that fertilization significantly influenced plant height, stem diameter, dry matter production, and yield. Notably, plants treated with Nitrofoska Triple 16 exhibited the highest yield (3.5 Mg ha^-1) and biomass accumulation (6656 kg ha^-1), while organic fertilization resulted in the lowest yield (1.6 Mg ha^-1) and biomass (3391 kg ha^-1). \n\nAt the pod-filling stage (90 days after planting), plants receiving urea and Triple 16 showed enhanced height and stem diameter compared to those under organic fertilization. The growth index, calculated from plant height and canopy width, did not significantly differ across treatments during flowering to pod-filling stages, although organic treatments consistently yielded lower growth indices.\n\nThe study also employed NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) readings to assess plant health and nutrient status. NDVI values were unaffected by fertilization source, while SPAD readings indicated significant differences influenced by the type and rate of fertilization at critical growth stages. A correlation was observed between SPAD values and final dry matter accumulation, suggesting that chlorophyll content may serve as an indicator of nutrient availability.\n\nYield components, including the number of pods and seeds per plant, were significantly higher in treatments with synthetic fertilizers compared to organic blends.

(2018) investigated the kinetics of cooking dry legumes, specifically soybeans (Glycine max) and red kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), focusing on the effects of presoaking versus unsoaked cooking on their softening rates. The research aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the softening processes during cooking, which are critical for achieving optimal texture in legumes.\n\nThe authors conducted experiments by heating unsoaked beans at temperatures ranging from 10 to 99.5°C and measuring changes in water absorption and hardness. They established that softening occurs through two primary mechanisms: “softening due to water absorption” and “softening due to heating.” The study revealed that the softening process is not linear; rather, it involves a two-step reaction after reaching a hardness threshold of approximately 30 N, which represents the lower limit of softening due to water absorption.\n\nUsing a first-order kinetic model, the authors derived rate constants for softening at various temperatures, applying the Arrhenius equation to predict cooking times based on temperature changes. They found that the rate of water absorption was significantly influenced by soaking temperature, with higher temperatures facilitating faster absorption. However, soaking at elevated temperatures (50–70°C) could lead to hardening, complicating the cooking process.\n\nThe results indicated that for both soybean and red kidney bean, the initial phase of softening was predominantly due to water absorption, while subsequent softening was attributed to heating effects, particularly at temperatures above 60°C. The study also highlighted that presoaked beans exhibited a more rapid softening rate compared to unsoaked beans, emphasizing the importance of soaking in the cooking process.\n\nThe kinetic analysis provided insights into the temperature dependence of softening rates, revealing that the apparent activation energy for softening due to heating was higher for presoaked beans than for unsoaked ones. This suggests that the structural changes in the beans, such as gelatinization of starch and denaturation of proteins, are more efficient when the beans are prehydrated.\n\nIn conclusion, the study by Koriyama et al. offers a comprehensive understanding of the cooking kinetics of dry legumes, demonstrating that both soaking and cooking temperatures significantly influence the softening process. The findings have practical implications for food science and technology, particularly in optimizing cooking methods for improved texture and palatability of legumes. The proposed kinetic model can aid in predicting cooking times, enhancing the efficiency of culinary practices involving legumes."}

Results indicated that extrusion significantly altered the viscosity characteristics of the beans, with extruded samples exhibiting more stable viscosity profiles compared to unprocessed beans.\n\nKey findings include:\n1. **Peak Viscosity (PV)**: Extrusion reduced PV in both cultivars, with Aura showing a higher peak viscosity at increased screw speeds, while Toska exhibited minimal response to screw speed changes. Increased water addition positively influenced PV for both cultivars.\n2. **Hot Paste Viscosity (HPV)**: HPV values were lower in extruded beans, indicating a reduction in the structural integrity of starch granules due to shear forces during processing. Higher water addition correlated with increased HPV.\n3. **Cold Paste Viscosity (CPV)**: CPV values decreased with higher screw speeds, suggesting a negative impact on gel formation ability due to increased shear. Conversely, higher water addition improved CPV, enhancing gel formation potential.\n4. **Breakdown (BD)**: Higher screw speeds resulted in increased BD, indicating greater susceptibility of the starch to disintegration during cooking. Water addition had variable effects on BD across cultivars.\n5. **Setback (SB)**: Extruded beans displayed lower SB values than unprocessed beans, suggesting reduced retrogradation tendencies due to starch degradation during extrusion.\n\nThe study concludes that extrusion-cooking effectively modifies the pasting properties of common beans, enhancing their functional characteristics for food applications. The findings underscore the importance of optimizing extrusion parameters to improve the nutritional and functional quality of bean-based products, particularly in the context of developing gluten-free food alternatives. This research contributes valuable insights into the processing of legumes, highlighting their potential as functional food ingredients. Further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes and the implications for consumer health is warranted."}

The research employed a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) post-column derivative method to measure both L-ascorbic acid (AsA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), providing a more accurate assessment than previously reported in the \"Fifth Table of Standard Japanese Food Composition,\" which suggested negligible VC in dehydrated legumes.\n\nThe findings indicated that VC content per 100 g of dry weight ranged from 0.24 mg in kidney beans to 4.14 mg in green peas, with yard beans exhibiting the highest values in both dehydrated (3.19 mg) and rehydrated forms (10.8 mg). Notably, soaking dehydrated seeds for 16 hours at 20°C significantly increased VC levels in black grams and mung beans by 3.1- and 4.5-fold, respectively. However, certain varieties of green peas lost VC during soaking, highlighting the variability in VC retention among legume types.\n\nThe study also assessed the impact of cooking on VC content, revealing that boiling resulted in a substantial loss (70-100%) of VC in most legumes, except for mung beans, which retained a higher VC content post-cooking (9.42 mg/100 g dry weight). This suggests that certain legumes can still provide nutritional benefits after cooking, contrary to common assumptions.\n\nImmature legume seeds were found to contain high levels of VC, comparable to fresh vegetables, with values exceeding 20 mg/100 g fresh weight in several varieties. The research underscores the importance of legume seeds as a potential source of VC, particularly when prepared correctly, and challenges the notion that dehydrated legumes are devoid of this essential nutrient.\n\nThe study's results have implications for dietary recommendations and food processing practices, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the mechanisms behind VC retention and enhancement in legumes during soaking and cooking. Overall, this research contributes valuable insights into the nutritional profile of legumes and their role in human diets, particularly in regions where they are staple foods."}

The emergence of ALS-resistant Palmer amaranth has created significant challenges for weed management in this crop, necessitating the exploration of alternative herbicide strategies.\n\nThe research evaluates sequential preemergence (PRE) followed by postemergence (POST) applications of very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA)-inhibiting herbicides, specifically dimethenamid-P, S-metolachlor, and pyroxasulfone, in comparison to traditional ALS-inhibiting herbicides. The study's objective was to determine the effectiveness of these herbicide combinations in controlling Palmer amaranth while ensuring crop safety.\n\nField trials conducted in 2020 and 2021 revealed that sequential applications of pendimethalin combined with dimethenamid-P or S-metolachlor resulted in over 85% control of Palmer amaranth, comparable to the effectiveness of pendimethalin followed by fomesafen, an ALS-inhibitor. In contrast, treatments involving pyroxasulfone exhibited inconsistent control and caused significant crop injury, leading to reduced yields. Notably, dimethenamid-P and S-metolachlor demonstrated excellent crop safety, with minimal injury observed across treatments.\n\nStatistical analyses indicated that the sequential PRE fb POST programs significantly reduced both the density and biomass of Palmer amaranth compared to PRE-only applications. The most effective treatments, such as pendimethalin + dimethenamid-P and pendimethalin + S-metolachlor, provided similar control levels to fomesafen-containing treatments while maintaining acceptable crop safety.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of integrating VLCFA-inhibiting herbicides into weed management strategies for dry edible beans, particularly in the context of managing herbicide-resistant weed populations. The findings suggest that these herbicide programs can effectively mitigate the impact of Palmer amaranth on crop yield while minimizing adverse effects on crop health.\n\nIn conclusion, the research highlights the potential of VLCFA-inhibiting herbicides as viable alternatives for managing ALS-resistant Palmer amaranth in dry edible beans. The results advocate for the adoption of integrated weed management practices that combine effective herbicide strategies with crop safety considerations, ultimately contributing to sustainable agricultural practices and improved crop productivity.

(2024) investigate the interactions between various cover crop species in dual mixtures to enhance shoot biomass production and weed suppression under contrasting environmental conditions. Conducted over two years in Triesdorf, Germany, the field experiment involved seven cover crop species: white mustard (Sinapis alba), oil radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleiformis), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum), common vetch (Vicia sativa), field pea (Pisum sativum), and field bean (Vicia faba). These species were grown in both pure stands and dual mixtures, with biomass harvested at the end of the growing season.\n\nThe results revealed that the shoot biomass of cover crop species in dual mixtures was closely related to their performance in pure stands. Notably, mustard and phacelia exhibited similar interactions in biomass production when paired with other species. Cruciferous species, particularly mustard and oil radish, demonstrated superior weed suppression capabilities, effectively outcompeting weeds even when mixed with less competitive partners. Conversely, legume species like Egyptian clover and common vetch showed limited weed suppression in pure stands.\n\nThe study identified that mixtures containing competitive species, such as mustard and oil radish, could achieve over-yielding effects—where biomass production exceeded expectations based on pure stand performance—especially when combined with less competitive species like Egyptian clover. This phenomenon was less pronounced under water-sufficient conditions, where the interactions among species were more stable, and the competitive advantage of cruciferous species persisted.\n\nStatistical analyses indicated a significant correlation between cover crop biomass and weed suppression, particularly under water-limited conditions. The biomass of cover crops explained a substantial portion of the variance in weed biomass, highlighting the importance of selecting species with high biomass potential for effective weed management. However, the study also noted that the inclusion of less competitive species in mixtures did not enhance weed suppression, suggesting that the dominant species' competitive traits are crucial for effective weed management.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings emphasize the importance of selecting competitive cover crop species for mixtures aimed at maximizing biomass production and weed suppression. The study advocates for the use of cruciferous species, particularly mustard and oil radish, as foundational components in cover crop mixtures, while also suggesting that future research should focus on identifying suitable non-legume partners to optimize cover crop performance in various cropping systems. This work contributes valuable insights into sustainable agricultural practices, particularly in the context of integrated weed management and enhancing soil health through cover cropping strategies."}

All identified strains were classified under the symbiovar phaseoli, indicating their potential for effective nodulation with common beans. Notably, the phylogenetic analysis of nodC and nifH genes suggested that the evolution of nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes occurred independently, highlighting the complexity of symbiotic interactions.\n\nThe study also demonstrated that the compatibility between rhizobial species and common bean varieties was influenced by soil characteristics. In Binxian soil, Rhizobium sp. I was more compatible with Jiadouwang, while Rhizobium sp. II showed better compatibility with Cuican. Conversely, in Muling soil, compatibility patterns were less distinct. The soil from Binxian was more acidic and nutrient-poor compared to Muling, which may have contributed to the observed differences in rhizobial diversity and compatibility.\n\nAnalytical methods employed included high-throughput sequencing for whole-genome analysis and phylogenetic tree construction based on gene sequences, which confirmed the distinctiveness of the novel genospecies.

SARC1 contains phaseolin and major lectins, while SMARC1N-PN1 lacks these proteins but compensates with higher levels of sulfur-rich proteins, resulting in increased concentrations of cysteine and methionine at the expense of S-methylcysteine.\n\nUnder controlled conditions, high sulfate treatment significantly increased seed yield in SMARC1N-PN1 by 8%, while SARC1 showed a decrease in seed weight under high sulfur conditions. Both genotypes exhibited altered concentrations of sulfur, sulfate, and S-methylcysteine in response to sulfur treatment, with SMARC1N-PN1 showing a 16% increase in cysteine concentration. Notably, proteomic analysis revealed that lipoxygenase-3, albumin-2, and α-amylase inhibitor β chain levels increased under high sulfur conditions, with lipoxygenase-3 being particularly responsive in SMARC1N-PN1.\n\nField trials confirmed a modest yield increase (3-15%) in both genotypes with sulfur fertilization, consistent with typical responses in common beans. Elemental analysis indicated that sulfur and sulfate concentrations were significantly elevated in both genotypes under high sulfur treatment, with SMARC1N-PN1 showing a 38% increase in sulfate concentration.\n\nThe findings suggest that the ability of SMARC1N-PN1 to accommodate increased sulfur amino acids is linked to its unique storage protein composition, which allows for enhanced plasticity in response to sulfur nutrition.

The authors highlight the significance of common bean as a staple food source globally, especially in developing countries, where it serves as an affordable source of protein and micronutrients.\n\nThe review begins with a historical overview of common bean domestication, which occurred approximately 8000 years ago, leading to the establishment of two primary genetic pools: Mesoamerican and Andean. The authors emphasize the recent availability of the common bean genome, which facilitates the application of advanced molecular techniques previously reserved for model organisms like Arabidopsis thaliana.\n\nKey findings include the identification of genes and transporters involved in nutrient uptake and homeostasis. For instance, the authors discuss the role of high-affinity phosphate transporters (Pht) that are upregulated under P deficiency, and the involvement of transcription factors such as PHR1 and microRNA PvmiR399 in the signaling pathways related to phosphorus availability. Additionally, the review notes that common bean can utilize internal phosphate sources during nutrient scarcity and that root architecture is modified to enhance nutrient acquisition.\n\nThe authors also address the critical roles of Fe and Zn in human nutrition and their biofortification potential in common bean. They report that common bean cultivars exhibit varying concentrations of these micronutrients, with the Andean pool generally having higher Fe levels and the Mesoamerican pool exhibiting greater Zn content.

(2017) investigates the relationship between shoot and root traits and drought resistance in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) using a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population derived from the cross MD 23–24 × SEA 5. Conducted at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in Colombia, the research aims to identify specific morpho-physiological traits that enhance drought resistance and to discover superior genotypes for breeding programs.\n\nThe experimental design included field trials under irrigated and rainfed conditions across three seasons, alongside greenhouse studies to assess root traits. A total of 121 genotypes were evaluated, including 111 RILs, two parental lines, and eight checks. Key findings indicate that drought resistance is positively correlated with deeper root systems, vigorous shoot growth, and effective mobilization of photosynthates to pods and seeds. Notably, pod harvest index (PHI) and seed number per area (SNA) emerged as critical selection criteria for improving drought resistance.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of root depth and total root length (TRL) in accessing water during drought. While drought stress reduced TRL, several RILs demonstrated enhanced root production under stress, indicating adaptive responses. The research identifies two distinct strategies among the RILs: \"water spender\" types, which exhibit deeper rooting and higher grain yield (GY) under drought, and \"water saver\" types, which conserve water and maintain yield through efficient photosynthate remobilization.\n\nStatistical analyses revealed significant correlations between canopy biomass (CB), GY, PHI, and SNA under both irrigated and drought conditions, emphasizing the role of these traits in drought adaptation. The study also notes transgressive segregation for several traits, suggesting potential for genetic improvement through breeding.\n\nOverall, this research provides valuable insights into the physiological traits associated with drought resistance in common bean, offering a framework for future breeding efforts aimed at enhancing resilience to drought stress. The identification of specific traits such as PHI and SNA as selection criteria could facilitate the development of improved bean varieties that are better adapted to changing climatic conditions."}

(2017) investigate the agricultural potential of short-season grain legumes—common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and lablab (Lablab purpureus)—in semi-arid Eastern Kenya, particularly in the context of climate variability. The study utilizes both field experiments and the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model to assess growth, development, and water use efficiency (WUE) of these legumes across different environmental conditions along the Machakos-Makueni transect.\n\nThe authors highlight the increasing risks posed by climate variability, including erratic rainfall patterns and rising temperatures, which threaten agricultural productivity in semi-arid regions. The study identifies key traits for adaptation among the legumes, such as early flowering and efficient pod and seed set before terminal drought. Common bean exhibits a conservative water use strategy, achieving stable yields (approximately 1,000 kg ha−1) but with limited potential for higher production. In contrast, cowpea demonstrates a more aggressive growth habit, achieving yields up to 3,000 kg ha−1 under optimal conditions, but is highly susceptible to in-season drought. Lablab appears best adapted to dry conditions, with yields exceeding 2,000 kg ha−1 even in low-potential environments.\n\nThe research employs rigorous analytical methods, including HPLC-DAD and MS/MS for phenolic compound analysis, and utilizes WUE as a critical metric for evaluating the legumes' performance. The findings reveal that WUEbiomass and WUEgrain vary significantly among the legumes, with lablab exhibiting the highest WUE (5–7 kg grain ha−1 mm−1), while cowpea shows the lowest (1.5–3.5 kg grain ha−1 mm−1). This variation underscores the importance of water use patterns in determining crop success in variable climates.\n\nThe APSIM model was calibrated and validated using data from field trials, demonstrating its utility in simulating the growth and yield of short-season legumes under varying rainfall and soil conditions. The model's predictions align closely with observed data, particularly for common bean, indicating its robustness for future applications in crop management and breeding strategies.\n\nOverall, the study emphasizes the potential of short-season grain legumes to enhance resilience in farming systems facing climate challenges. The authors advocate for site-specific utilization of these legumes, tailored to their distinct morphological and physiological traits, to optimize agricultural productivity in semi-arid Eastern Kenya.

(2017) investigates the genetic architecture of flooding tolerance in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) using a Middle-American diversity panel comprising 272 genotypes. Given the increasing incidence of flooding due to climate change, understanding the physiological and genetic responses of common beans to this abiotic stress is critical for breeding programs aimed at improving crop resilience.\n\nA greenhouse phenotyping protocol was developed to assess flooding tolerance at early growth stages, focusing on seven traits: germination rate, total weight, shoot weight, root weight, hypocotyl length, SPAD index (chlorophyll content), and adventitious root formation. The study revealed significant genotype × treatment interactions, indicating variability in flooding responses among genotypes. Notably, black and small red beans exhibited the least sensitivity to flooding during germination, while pinto and great northern beans demonstrated the highest tolerance at the seedling stage.\n\nA genome-wide association study (GWAS) utilizing approximately 150,000 SNP markers identified several loci associated with flooding tolerance traits. Key findings include significant peaks at Pv08/1.6 Mb and Pv02/41 Mb, linked to root weight and germination rate, respectively. These loci are syntenic with previously identified QTLs in soybean, suggesting conserved genetic pathways for flooding tolerance across these legumes.\n\nThe study also classified genotypes into races based on phylogenetic analysis, revealing that Durango/Jalisco genotypes generally exhibited greater flooding tolerance compared to Mesoamerican counterparts. The research highlights the importance of eco-geographical variations in the phenotypic responses to flooding, with distinct adaptation strategies observed among different races.\n\nCandidate genes associated with flooding tolerance were identified, including those involved in metabolic pathways critical for stress response, such as alternative oxidase (AOX2) and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. The presence of ERF transcription factors, particularly RAP2.6L, was noted as a potential regulator of flooding tolerance mechanisms.\n\nOverall, this comprehensive study provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of flooding tolerance in common beans, identifying key loci and candidate genes that can be targeted for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs. The findings underscore the necessity for further research to elucidate the physiological pathways involved in flooding tolerance, particularly in the Andean gene pool, to enhance food security in the face of climate change."}

The research is motivated by the observation that modern breeding practices have often overlooked the trait of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF), leading to concerns about the potential loss of this important trait in high-yielding cultivars. The study aims to assess whether heirloom varieties, which may retain greater genetic diversity and SNF capacity, can contribute positively to modern breeding programs.\n\nA panel of 42 genotypes, comprising 23 heirloom and 19 conventional varieties, was evaluated across three locations in Ontario, Canada, during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. The genotypes were characterized using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to analyze genetic relatedness. Field trials measured various agronomic traits, including yield, days to flowering, and seed composition traits, while nitrogen fixation was assessed using the natural abundance method to determine the percentage of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa).\n\nResults indicated significant variation in NF capacity among the genotypes, with five heirloom varieties fixing over 60% of their nitrogen from the atmosphere. However, on average, heirloom genotypes did not significantly outperform conventional varieties in terms of nitrogen fixation. Notably, Middle American genotypes exhibited higher nitrogen fixation than Andean genotypes, corroborating previous findings in the field. The heirloom variety Coco Sophie emerged as the top nitrogen fixer, demonstrating a unique genetic background that includes contributions from both Andean and Middle American gene pools.\n\nYield analysis revealed no significant differences between heirloom and conventional varieties, suggesting that incorporating heirloom genotypes into breeding programs may not compromise yield potential. The study also found that heirloom varieties generally flowered and matured earlier than conventional ones, which could be advantageous in certain growing conditions.\n\nGenetic diversity analysis showed that the heirloom and conventional categories had similar nucleotide diversity, contradicting the hypothesis that modern breeding has eroded genetic diversity. This finding suggests that heirloom beans could serve as a valuable genetic resource for enhancing nitrogen fixation traits in modern breeding efforts, particularly in organic production systems where synthetic inputs are minimized.\n\nIn conclusion, while heirloom beans did not universally outperform conventional varieties in nitrogen fixation, they represent an underutilized genetic resource that could enhance the sustainability and resilience of dry bean production. The study highlights the importance of integrating heirloom varieties into breeding programs to improve nitrogen fixation and overall agronomic performance, particularly in low-input agricultural systems."}

The research aimed to identify genotypes that could maintain high yields while reducing reliance on nitrogen fertilizers, thereby improving the ecological footprint of common bean production.\n\nThe study was conducted over three years in replicated field trials on nitrogen-poor soils, assessing traits such as the percentage of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa), yield, and other yield-related characteristics under four nitrogen regimes: no nitrogen, high nitrogen (100 kg ha−1), and two rhizobia treatments. Results indicated significant variation among genotypes for all analyzed traits, with nitrogen application consistently reducing %Ndfa and influencing yield. The application of rhizobia had inconsistent effects on traits across years, suggesting that the effectiveness of rhizobial inoculation may be influenced by environmental conditions.\n\nKey findings revealed that nitrogen application inhibited symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) to varying degrees among genotypes, with some, such as RIL_38, RIL_119, and RIL_131, demonstrating both high yield and good nitrogen-fixing ability. However, the correlation between yield and %Ndfa was inconsistent, indicating that breeding for improved SNF may be complex due to the multifactorial nature of these traits.\n\nAnalytical methods employed included the 15N natural abundance technique to estimate %Ndfa, revealing that genotypes like RIL_38 maintained higher nitrogen fixation even under nitrogen application.

The research highlights how these viruses manipulate host-aphid interactions to promote vector migration away from infected plants, thereby enhancing virus transmission.\n\nUsing choice tests, olfactometry, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the authors demonstrate that both the specialist aphid Aphis fabae and the generalist Myzus persicae show a preference for settling on uninfected plants over those infected with any of the three viruses. Specifically, the study reveals that all three viruses induce significant alterations in the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by infected plants, which are crucial for aphid host selection. Notably, the emission of the attractant sesquiterpene α-copaene is suppressed in infected plants, suggesting a common mechanism by which these viruses discourage aphid settlement.\n\nThe olfactometry experiments indicate that while BCMNV-infected plants repel aphids through emitted VOCs, the other viruses also contribute to a similar repellent effect by altering the overall VOC profile. The study identifies several electrophysiologically active VOCs, including nonanal, octanal, and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), which are implicated in aphid behavior. The authors conclude that these virus-induced changes in VOC emissions likely enhance the dispersal of virus-bearing aphids, facilitating the spread of the viruses to adjacent uninfected plants.\n\nThe findings underscore the complex interplay between viral infection and aphid behavior, suggesting that understanding these interactions could inform strategies for managing virus transmission in crops. The study also raises questions about the ecological implications of virus-induced alterations in plant volatile emissions and their potential applications in agricultural practices, such as developing sensors for early detection of viral infections based on VOC profiles.

Conducted through an online questionnaire, the study included 1,106 participants with a mean age of 34.5 years. The findings reveal a significant increase in body mass index (BMI) during the pandemic (P < 0.001), with notable shifts in dietary intake patterns.\n\nParticipants reported decreased consumption of dairy products (milk and yogurt), red meat, fish, and fast foods, while intake of whole bread, legumes (including chickpeas, lentils, and various beans), nuts, seeds, high vitamin C vegetables and fruits, and water increased significantly (P < 0.001). Additionally, there was a marked rise in the consumption of dietary supplements, particularly vitamin C and zinc (P < 0.001).\n\nThe study highlights a positive correlation between dietary intake and socioeconomic status (SES), with higher SES associated with greater consumption of dairy, red meat, and high vitamin C fruits both before and during the pandemic (P < 0.001). Conversely, those with lower SES reported higher egg consumption, likely due to its lower cost compared to other protein sources.\n\nStatistical analyses utilized Mann–Whitney U tests and Kruskal–Wallis tests to assess differences in dietary habits and weight status before and during the pandemic. The results indicate that the pandemic has led to both positive and negative changes in dietary behaviors, influenced by factors such as increased home cooking and reduced access to certain foods.\n\nThe authors conclude that these findings are crucial for health professionals and policymakers, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to improve dietary quality and address the nutritional challenges exacerbated by the pandemic. The study underscores the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors and dietary choices during a global health crisis, providing valuable insights for future public health strategies."}
{"doi": "10.3389_fsufs.2023.1052392", "summary": "The study by El-Mehy et al. (2023) investigates the effects of relay intercropping maize (Zea mays L.) with common dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) on nitrogen (N) fertilizer rationalization, productivity, and economic viability. Conducted over two growing seasons (2020 and 2021) at Sers El-Layian Station, Egypt, the research evaluates three co-growth durations of maize relative to the flowering stage of beans (60 days, 45 days, and 30 days) alongside three levels of N fertilizer application (190.4, 238.0, and 285.6 kg N/ha).\n\nKey findings indicate that the shortest co-growth period (30 days) significantly enhanced the total land equivalent ratio (LER) and area time equivalent ratio (ATER), achieving LER values of 1.99 under the highest N level (N3). This suggests that intercropping maize with beans can yield greater productivity per unit area compared to monoculture systems. The study also highlights that while maize yield increased with higher N levels, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was maximized at the intermediate N level (238.0 kg N/ha), which was 18.34% more efficient than the highest level (285.6 kg N/ha).\n\nThe competitive dynamics between the two crops were assessed using various indices. Results showed a greater dominance of maize over beans, particularly in longer co-growth periods, which negatively impacted bean yield components such as pod number and seed weight. Conversely, the economic analysis revealed that intercropping provided significant monetary advantages, with the intercropping advantage index (IAI) indicating higher profitability compared to monoculture.\n\nThe study concludes that optimizing the co-growth duration and N fertilizer application can enhance resource utilization and reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers, thereby promoting sustainable agricultural practices. The authors advocate for the adoption of this intercropping system as a viable strategy for smallholder farmers to improve productivity and economic returns while minimizing environmental impacts."}

(2023) investigate the medium-term effects of intercropping maize (Zea mays) with Urochloa brizantha (palisade grass) on subsequent crops in a no-till system over five years (2014-2018). The research addresses the knowledge gap regarding the influence of Urochloa residues on soil fertility and crop performance in a common bean-wheat-maize rotation.\n\nThe experimental design involved two treatments: monocropping maize (MS) and intercropping maize with U. brizantha (IS), with 12 replications in a randomized complete block design. Soil fertility parameters, including pH, soil organic matter (SOM), phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S–SO4^2−), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and base saturation (BS), were significantly enhanced in the IS treatment compared to MS. Notably, U. brizantha improved soil fertility over four years, with root biomass concentrated primarily in the upper 0.2 m of soil.\n\nThe intercropping system positively influenced the growth and yield of subsequent crops, including common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize. The study reports significant increases in leaf nutrient concentrations (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and grain yields across all crops under IS. For instance, common bean yields were 606 kg ha−1 and 414 kg ha−1 higher in the first and second growing seasons, respectively, under IS compared to MS. Wheat and maize also exhibited improved yield components and grain quality, with IS enhancing shoot dry matter mass and crude protein content.\n\nSoil sampling revealed that IS treatment resulted in higher root dry matter mass and a more favorable root distribution profile compared to MS. The findings suggest that U. brizantha's vigorous root system contributes to improved soil structure, nutrient cycling, and moisture retention, thereby enhancing crop resilience to abiotic stressors.\n\nThe study concludes that intercropping maize with U. brizantha is a viable agronomic practice that not only improves soil fertility and nutrient availability but also enhances the growth and yield of subsequent crops in rotation. This approach is particularly relevant for sustainable agricultural systems in tropical regions, where soil degradation and nutrient depletion are pressing concerns. The authors advocate for the adoption of intercropping systems to optimize resource use and promote long-term agricultural sustainability."}

The research utilized a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between the drought-tolerant line BAT477 and the drought-susceptible variety DOR364. The mapping population was evaluated over three years under both drought and fully irrigated conditions, focusing on traits such as overall seed yield, yield per day, 100-seed weight, days to flowering, and days to maturity.\n\nThe genetic map was constructed using a combination of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, resulting in a total map length of 1,087.5 cM across 11 linkage groups. The map achieved an average marker density of one marker every 5.9 cM, with some gaps larger than 15 cM primarily on linkage groups b03, b09, and b11. The study identified a total of 49 QTL across the three years, with a notable concentration of QTL for 100-seed weight (27 QTL), followed by yield per day (12 QTL) and overall yield (10 QTL). QTL for days to flowering and maturity were also detected, indicating a quantitative inheritance pattern for all traits assessed.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the majority of QTL for yield and yield components were influenced by alleles from both parents, suggesting that both contributed positively to these traits. Notably, the QTL for seed weight were predominantly associated with the DOR364 parent, indicating potential for transgressive segregation in the RIL population. The study highlighted the importance of seed weight and phenological traits as reliable indicators of drought tolerance, with QTL for these traits showing stability across years and environments.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential for utilizing this genetic map in breeding programs aimed at improving drought resistance in common beans, particularly within the Mesoamerican genepool. The research contributes valuable insights into the genetic basis of drought tolerance and provides a framework for future studies focused on enhancing crop resilience to water stress in regions where common beans are a staple food source."}

The research employs quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, association analysis, and colocation studies, revealing significant genomic regions on chromosomes Pv01 and Pv06 that influence pod phenotype.\n\nThe analysis identified 35 QTL for PMTs distributed across seven chromosomes, with a notable concentration on Pv01 and Pv06. The study established 15 consensus regions for PMTs by comparing these QTL with previously reported data, enhancing the understanding of the genetic architecture underlying pod morphology. The QTL identified included traits such as pod length (PL), pod width (PLW), pod thickness (PTH), and seed weight (SW), with the most significant QTL explaining up to 43% of the phenotypic variation for PLW.\n\nFor EPC, the authors identified two major loci with epistatic effects on Pv01 and Pv06, suggesting a complex inheritance model. The segregation analysis indicated that EPC is governed by two independent loci, with the ‘Musica’ alleles being necessary for expressing the edible pod phenotype. The study also highlighted the significant correlation between PMTs and EPC, indicating that traits such as PL and PLW are associated with pod edibility.\n\nGene ontology enrichment analysis revealed a significant overrepresentation of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid metabolic process and auxin response within the consensus QTL regions. Specifically, genes encoding dirigent proteins and laccases were identified, suggesting their involvement in lignin biosynthesis, which is crucial for pod structure and edibility. The auxin response genes identified in the EPC regions further support the hypothesis that auxin signaling plays a role in pod wall fiber deposition, influencing the edible characteristics of snap beans.\n\nThe findings of this study provide valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling pod traits in common beans, which are essential for breeding programs aimed at improving snap bean quality. The identification of consensus QTL and candidate genes associated with PMTs and EPC lays the groundwork for future research focused on enhancing the nutritional and culinary qualities of common beans."}

Utilizing a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between hard-seeded (H68-4) and soft-seeded (BK04001) parents, the research aimed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with seed hardness and develop molecular markers for breeding applications.\n\nField trials were conducted over three years (2014-2016) at two locations in Manitoba, Canada. The RIL population was phenotyped for seed hardness traits, specifically stone seed percentage (SSP) and hydration capacity (HC), using the AACC method 56-35.01. Cooking quality was assessed through visual appeal scores of cooked beans. Genotyping was performed using a genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) approach, resulting in the identification of 619 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for linkage mapping.\n\nQTL analysis revealed a major QTL on chromosome 7, previously associated with seed hydration, alongside two novel QTL on chromosomes 1 and 2 that significantly influence SSP and HC. The QTL on chromosome 7 was linked to the Asp gene, known for its role in seed coat luster, while the QTLs on chromosomes 1 and 2 contributed to the hard-seeded phenotype. The phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by the major QTL on chromosome 7 ranged from 28.5% to 43.9%, indicating its substantial effect on seed hardness.\n\nThe study also identified a major QTL affecting the visual appeal of cooked beans on chromosome 4, suggesting that cooking quality traits may be inherited independently from seed hardness. The heritability estimates for SSP and HC were high (>90%), indicating a strong genetic basis for these traits despite environmental influences.\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of seed coats revealed differences in surface texture between the parents, with shiny seeds exhibiting smoother surfaces compared to the rougher texture of matte seeds. This morphological distinction may influence water uptake and, consequently, seed hardness.\n\nOverall, the findings underscore the oligogenic nature of seed hardness in black beans and highlight the potential for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs aimed at improving cooking quality and reducing the incidence of hard-to-cook defects. The identification of stable QTLs and associated SNP markers provides valuable resources for enhancing the genetic improvement of common bean varieties. Future research should focus on characterizing the underlying genes within the identified QTL regions to further elucidate the mechanisms governing seed hardness and cooking quality."}

(2016) investigates the impact of drought on rainfed common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production in Goiás, Brazil, focusing on the wet and dry growing seasons. The research employs crop simulation models to characterize environmental conditions and assess drought stress levels, aiming to inform breeding strategies for developing stress-tolerant, high-yielding germplasm.\n\nThe authors identify that common bean cultivation in Goiás is predominantly rainfed, with significant yield differences observed between the wet (average yield of 1700 kg/ha) and dry (1500 kg/ha) seasons compared to the fully irrigated winter season (2700 kg/ha). The study highlights that drought stress is a major constraint, particularly in the dry season, where terminal and reproductive drought stress occurs in approximately 24% of the seasons for the cultivars Pérola and BRS Radiante.\n\nUsing the CSM-CROPGRO-DRY BEAN model, the researchers simulate crop growth under various environmental conditions, integrating weather, soil types (Oxisol, Ultisol, Inceptisol), and management practices. They categorize the rainfed environments into two groups: highly favorable environments (HFE) and favorable environments (FE), with HFE accounting for 44% of the wet season and 58% of the dry season production area. The model reveals that drought stress significantly impacts yields, particularly in the dry season, where the average relative water stress impact (RWSI) is around 50%.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate sowing dates to mitigate drought impacts, suggesting that early sowing can reduce yield losses. The authors argue that the current breeding program, which primarily tests genotypes under well-watered conditions in the winter season, may not adequately prepare cultivars for the stresses encountered in rainfed environments. They recommend adapting breeding strategies to incorporate selection for drought tolerance and other abiotic stresses prevalent in the rainfed target population of environments (TPEs).\n\nIn conclusion, the findings underscore the necessity for a more nuanced approach in common bean breeding that considers the variability of environmental stresses across different growing seasons. By integrating crop modeling with breeding practices, the study aims to enhance the resilience and productivity of common bean cultivars in the face of climate variability and water scarcity."}

The objective is to enhance the micronutrient density of these staple crops to combat nutritional deficiencies in target populations.\n\nThe authors conducted a comparative analysis using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as a reference method to establish baseline Fe and Zn concentrations in seed samples sourced from various breeding programs. The study involved calibrating EDXRF with a subset of samples and validating the method with another set, revealing that EDXRF results closely matched ICP-MS findings, with an average discrepancy of ±1 mg kg⁻¹ for both micronutrients.\n\nThe research highlights the limitations of using whole grains for EDXRF analysis due to their larger size, which resulted in poor correlation (r² < 0.5) between EDXRF intensity and ICP-MS values. Consequently, grinding the grains into flour significantly improved calibration statistics (r² > 0.92) and reproducibility (coefficient of variation < 4%). The study confirms that EDXRF can effectively measure Fe and Zn concentrations in flour samples, making it a viable alternative to traditional methods like ICP-OES, which are costly and labor-intensive.\n\nThe calibration utilized non-matrix matched glass standards, allowing for a robust and practical approach to EDXRF calibration across different laboratories without the need for transporting plant materials, thus mitigating quarantine issues. The study establishes that the limits of quantification for Fe and Zn were suitable for high-throughput screening, with values indicating that EDXRF can reliably support biofortification efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings suggest that EDXRF is a rapid, cost-effective, and accurate method for screening Fe and Zn in common bean, maize, and cowpea, facilitating the identification of nutrient-dense genotypes in breeding programs. This advancement has significant implications for improving dietary micronutrient intake in populations reliant on these staple crops, thereby contributing to global nutrition security."}

Genomic DNA was extracted from the isolates, and the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was amplified using universal primers ITS1 and ITS4, yielding an approximately 700 bp product. This product was subsequently digested with four restriction endonucleases: MseI, HincII, AvaII, and MfeI, revealing distinct RFLP patterns that allowed for the differentiation of AG4 HGI and AG4 HGII subgroups.\n\nThe study found that the majority of the isolates (93.8%) belonged to the AG4 HGI subgroup, indicating a predominance of this subgroup in the region. The virulence of all AG4 isolates was assessed and found to be high, with no significant differences in pathogenicity among the isolates. The research highlighted that traditional anastomosis grouping methods were insufficient for subgroup differentiation, emphasizing the utility of molecular techniques for accurate classification.\n\nThe use of AvaII was noted as a novel finding in this study, as it was effective in subgrouping alongside previously utilized enzymes.

The results showed significant genetic variance, with broad-sense heritability values of 71.90% for the IAPAR 44 x IAPAR 31 hybrid and 79.65% for the Diamante Negro x TPS Bonito hybrid, indicating that genetic factors predominantly contribute to phenotypic variance.\n\nThe findings suggest that selection for high copper concentration can be effectively initiated in the F2 generation, where genetic variability is maximized. This study is notable as it is the first to document an increase in copper concentration in common bean seeds through genetic breeding, paralleling previous successes in enhancing iron and zinc concentrations.\n\nThe implications for plant breeding are significant, as the ability to increase copper levels in common beans could enhance their nutritional value and contribute to human health. Additionally, this genetic improvement could reduce reliance on copper fertilizers, promoting agricultural sustainability. Future research should focus on elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying copper accumulation and exploring the number of genes involved in this trait."}

Conducted in a controlled greenhouse environment using a soilless nutrient solution system, the research comprised two experiments with different calcium levels and cultivars.\n\nIn the first experiment, five calcium concentrations (1.10, 1.65, 2.20, 2.75, and 3.30 mmol L^-1) were tested across three cultivars: Iraí, BRS Expedito, and Carioca. Results indicated that increasing calcium concentrations significantly enhanced the dry mass of shoots and roots, grain yield, and calcium accumulation in both leaves and grains. Notably, the highest calcium concentration did not adversely affect the accumulation of potassium and magnesium. The study found a linear relationship between calcium concentration and growth metrics, with optimal calcium levels identified between 2.20 and 3.30 mmol L^-1.\n\nThe second experiment expanded the calcium range (2.20 to 4.95 mmol L^-1) and focused on two cultivars (BRS Expedito and Carioca). Similar trends were observed, with significant increases in dry mass, grain yield, and nutrient accumulation. The dry mass of shoots and roots showed a linear response to calcium concentrations, while the number of pods per plant and grain yield also increased significantly. The calcium concentration in grains increased linearly, suggesting that higher calcium availability in the nutrient solution can enhance the nutritional quality of common bean grains.\n\nAnalytical methods included atomic absorption spectrophotometry for determining nutrient concentrations in plant tissues, revealing that leaves were significant accumulators of calcium, particularly at the pod-filling stage. The study emphasizes the importance of calcium in enhancing plant growth and yield, suggesting that calcium management in nutrient solutions can improve the nutritional quality of common beans.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential for breeding programs to select cultivars with superior calcium uptake and utilization, which may lead to improved grain quality and yield under varying nutrient conditions. This research contributes valuable insights into the mineral nutrition of common beans, highlighting the need for further studies in soil conditions to optimize calcium fertilization practices."}

The research utilized rumen fluid from three fistulated Holstein cows as the inoculum for the in vitro incubation process, employing a completely randomized factorial design (4x4).\n\nKey findings indicate that all byproducts significantly influenced in vitro digestibility (p < 0.05). Notably, castor bean byproducts resulted in the lowest cumulative gas production after 48 hours of incubation, attributed to its high fiber and lignin content, which negatively impacted degradability. In contrast, canola and forage radish at the 70% replacement level did not adversely affect dry matter (DM) degradability, with canola showing the highest digestibility increase of 0.22% per unit increase in replacement level.\n\nChemical analyses revealed that castor bean and forage radish had high crude protein contents (420.2 g kg^-1 and 393.7 g kg^-1, respectively), while castor bean and canola exhibited elevated neutral detergent fiber (NDF) levels (523.3 g kg^-1 and 410.3 g kg^-1). The study also highlighted that the presence of lignin in castor bean contributes to a greater indigestible fraction, limiting the potentially digestible fraction and causing rumen filling, which restricts dry matter intake.\n\nGas production profiles indicated that castor bean consistently produced lower gas volumes, with a linear decrease of 0.74 mL g^-1 for each percentage increase in its inclusion. Conversely, canola, forage radish, and black sunflower exhibited quadratic responses, with canola yielding the highest cumulative gas production, suggesting its superior nutritional profile for rumen microorganisms.\n\nThe study concludes that while canola enhances digestibility, it also leads to increased gas production, which may have implications for methane emissions. Forage radish, however, provided a balance of high digestibility with lower gas production, making it a potentially favorable alternative in ruminant diets. These findings underscore the potential of biodiesel byproducts as viable feed alternatives, contributing to sustainable livestock production while addressing waste management in the biodiesel industry. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term effects of these byproducts on animal health and performance."}

The experimental design employed randomized blocks with four treatments: oats (Avena strigosa), turnip (Raphanus sativus), vetch (Vicia sativa), and spontaneous plants, with five replications.\n\nThe results indicated that oats produced the highest dry matter yield (4,900 kg ha^-1), statistically similar to turnip (4,000 kg ha^-1), while spontaneous plants yielded the least (1,180 kg ha^-1). Vetch's performance was suboptimal, yielding only 2,375 kg ha^-1, likely due to adverse environmental conditions. The bean yield was significantly influenced by the preceding cover crop, with the highest yield (1,204 kg ha^-1) following oats, while yields after vetch and spontaneous plants were considerably lower (697 kg ha^-1 and 575 kg ha^-1, respectively).\n\nSoil physical properties were assessed at depths of 0.05 to 0.20 m. The study found no significant differences in macroporosity, microporosity, or total porosity across treatments, suggesting that the cover crops did not enhance soil porosity. However, a notable difference in soil bulk density was observed in the 0.05 to 0.10 m layer, with the highest density (1.18 kg dm^-3) recorded in plots following spontaneous plants, attributed to their lower dry matter yield.\n\nThe findings underscore the effectiveness of oats and turnip as cover crops in enhancing bean yields and maintaining soil health in no-till systems. The study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate cover crops to optimize both crop productivity and soil physical properties, particularly in regions prone to drought. The results contribute to the understanding of sustainable agricultural practices and the role of cover crops in improving soil management and crop yields. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term effects of different cover crops on soil health and crop performance."}

(2007) investigated the short-term responses of photosynthetic membrane lipids and photochemical efficiency in two legumes, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), under high irradiance (HI) conditions. The primary leaves of two common bean cultivars (Carioca and Negro Huasteco) and one cowpea cultivar (Epace 10) were subjected to HI of 2000 µmol m–2 s–1 for durations of 10, 20, and 30 minutes. \n\nThe researchers measured chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, including initial fluorescence (F0), maximum fluorescence (Fm), and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), to assess the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII). Results indicated that the common bean genotypes exhibited a significant reduction in Fm after 20 minutes of HI, with a subsequent slight recovery at 30 minutes. In contrast, cowpea showed only minor fluctuations in Fv/Fm, suggesting greater tolerance to HI stress. Specifically, Epace 10 demonstrated a recovery of Fv/Fm values at 30 minutes, indicating effective repair mechanisms in response to photoinhibition.\n\nThe study also evaluated photochemical (qP) and non-photochemical (qN) quenching. Cowpea maintained higher qP and lower qN values under HI, reflecting its enhanced efficiency in utilizing absorbed energy and dissipating excess energy. Conversely, common bean genotypes displayed increased lipid peroxidation, as indicated by elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, particularly after 20 minutes of HI exposure, suggesting oxidative damage to cell membranes.\n\nThe authors concluded that cowpea possesses superior mechanisms for photoprotection and membrane integrity maintenance under HI compared to common bean, which suffers from irreversible photoinhibition. This study highlights the importance of cultivar selection in breeding programs aimed at improving stress tolerance in legumes, particularly in environments characterized by high irradiance and temperature. Future research is suggested to explore the biochemical pathways involved in the observed differences in photoprotection and recovery mechanisms, including the role of the xanthophyll cycle and D1 protein regeneration in PSII."}

The collection, sourced globally, was genotyped using over 2,000 SNPs through Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS), revealing a population structure of approximately 69% Andean, 26% Middle American, and 5% admixture. The YBC was evaluated across two major U.S. bean production regions—Michigan (MI) and Nebraska (NE)—over two years, focusing on traits such as days to flower, seed weight, water uptake, and cooking time.\n\nThe phenotypic analysis demonstrated significant variability in cooking times, ranging from 17 to 123 minutes, with NE exhibiting longer and more variable cooking times compared to MI. Notably, 20 genotypes cooked within 20 minutes in MI, while eight genotypes cooked within 31 minutes in NE. Environmental factors, including elevation and humidity, significantly influenced both water uptake and cooking time, with NE's higher elevation contributing to the observed hardshell trait in many genotypes.\n\nGenome-wide association analyses identified SNPs associated with cooking time, particularly highlighting a candidate gene, Phvul.004G038700, located on chromosome Pv04, which encodes a polygalacturonase. This enzyme is implicated in the softening of beans during cooking, suggesting its role in the fast-cooking trait. Other significant SNPs were located on chromosomes Pv01, Pv03, Pv06, Pv08, and Pv10, with no overlap in significant SNPs between the two environments, indicating the necessity of multi-environment testing for accurate trait evaluation.\n\nThe study also classified the YBC based on phenotypic traits, revealing that Andean genotypes tended to have faster cooking times than Middle Americans in NE, while the latter showed a peak at shorter cooking times in MI. The analysis of cooking time heritability indicated moderate to high estimates, particularly in MI (0.80) compared to NE (0.63), reinforcing the importance of environmental context in breeding programs.\n\nOverall, the YBC serves as a valuable resource for breeding programs aimed at enhancing consumer-focused traits such as cooking time and nutritional quality in yellow beans. The findings underscore the potential for utilizing genetic diversity in yellow beans to improve cooking efficiency and consumer acceptance, particularly in regions where beans are dietary staples.

Key traits evaluated included severity of angular leaf spot (ALS), plant architecture (PAG), and grain yield (YIELD).\n\nThe results indicated that additive genetic effects predominated for ALS and PAG, while YIELD exhibited both additive and dominance effects depending on the season, highlighting its complexity. Notably, the interaction between general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) was significant for YIELD across seasons, suggesting that environmental factors influence trait expression.\n\nThe cultivar ‘BRS Estilo’ emerged as a promising parent due to its favorable GCA estimates for ALS, PAG, and YIELD. The study identified genes controlling these traits in eight of the twelve parents, emphasizing the potential for recurrent selection as a breeding strategy to enhance these traits simultaneously.\n\nStatistical analyses revealed significant differences between the two parental groups, particularly in ALS severity, where group 2 (carioca parents) demonstrated superior resistance. The GCA estimates indicated that parents from group 2 had a higher frequency of favorable alleles for ALS resistance.

The research aims to quantify fluoride levels across different regions of Ethiopia, as these legumes can absorb fluoride from environmental sources, which poses potential health risks.\n\nUsing ion-selective electrode potentiometry, the study measured fluoride concentrations in legume samples collected from four regions: Asella, Migera, Sebeta, and Guder. The results revealed a significant range of fluoride levels, from 1.9 mg/kg in green gram to 22.8 mg/kg in fava beans from Asella. Specifically, fava beans exhibited the highest fluoride concentration, while white lupin and green gram showed lower levels, indicating a potential health risk associated with the consumption of fava and kidney beans, particularly from regions with high fluoride exposure.\n\nStatistical analysis (ANOVA) indicated significant differences in fluoride levels among samples from different regions, attributed to variations in soil fluoride content, pH, and environmental factors. The study found that daily consumption of 100 g of fava and kidney beans could exceed the safe fluoride intake threshold of 3 mg/day set by the Food and Nutrition Board of the USA, while green gram and white lupin remain within safe limits.\n\nThe study also compared fluoride levels in Ethiopian legumes with existing literature, noting that the fluoride concentrations in Ethiopian kidney beans (2.4-13.0 mg/kg) were lower than those reported in Pakistan (31.7 mg/kg), while fava beans showed much higher levels than those from India (0.015 mg/kg).

Key parameters assessed included water content, thousand seed weight, and physiological potential through germination and vigor tests (first germination count, seedling emergence in sand, emergence speed index, and electrical conductivity).\n\nResults indicated that prostrate genotypes (growth type III) such as Ouro Negro and BRSMG Madrepérola, along with the semi-prostrate Ouro Vermelho (growth type II/III), exhibited superior physiological potential across both sowing seasons. Notably, seeds harvested during the dry season demonstrated higher physiological quality compared to those from the winter season, attributed to favorable climatic conditions that minimized seed deterioration.\n\nStatistical analysis revealed significant interactions between genotypes and sowing times for water content, germination, seedling emergence, and vigor metrics. In the dry season, germination rates exceeded 70% for Ouro Vermelho, Ouro Negro, and BRSMG Madrepérola, while Manteigão Vermelho consistently fell below this threshold. The study highlights that the genetic constitution of Manteigão Vermelho may limit its performance, as it is less explored in breeding programs.\n\nThe emergence speed index (IVE) and electrical conductivity tests further corroborated the findings, with the highest vigor observed in seeds from the dry season.

Two sowing densities were tested: 10 plants m⁻¹ (TPM) and 15 plants m⁻¹ (FPM). The experimental design included various control and coexistence periods (0-80 days after emergence, DAE) to assess the critical period for interference prevention (CPIP), the period before interference (PBI), and the total period of interference prevention (TPIP).\n\nThe predominant weed species identified were Nicandra physaloides, Digitaria nuda, and Brachiaria plantaginea. Results indicated that the CPIP for FPM was reduced by four days compared to TPM, while the PBI increased by seven days in FPM. The accumulation of weed dry mass was inversely correlated with crop productivity, with a more significant yield reduction observed in FPM due to higher weed competition. Specifically, crop yields decreased by 70.6% in FPM and 70.3% in TPM when weeds were allowed to coexist throughout the crop cycle.\n\nPhytosociological analysis revealed that the weed community was more diverse at higher density (19 species in FPM vs. 17 in TPM), with the Poaceae family being the most represented. Weed density decreased over time, while dry mass increased, indicating that fewer competitive individuals persisted as the experiment progressed. Notably, Nicandra physaloides exhibited the highest relative importance index (RI) in both treatments, particularly in TPM, where it thrived due to reduced competition for resources.\n\nThe findings suggest that higher sowing density enhances the competitive ability of common bean against certain weed species, thereby altering the timing of interference periods. The study concludes that managing sowing density can be an effective strategy for improving weed control and crop yield in common bean cultivation.

Conducted in pots filled with sandy soil from a 'Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo distrófico', the research aimed to elucidate the impact of these treatments on vegetative growth, root development, and grain yield.\n\nThe results indicated that co-inoculation did not significantly enhance vegetative growth or grain yield compared to single inoculations. However, it did increase root volume when no chemical treatment was applied. Specifically, root dry matter production was highest with A. brasilense alone or in combination with fungicide or insecticide and R. tropici. The combination of fungicide, insecticide, and A. brasilense notably improved shoot dry matter and grain yield per plant.\n\nA linear response to nitrogen fertilization was observed, with increases in vegetative growth, root development, pod production, and grain yield up to the highest N dose of 120 kg ha^-1. This suggests that while biological nitrogen fixation via inoculation can be beneficial, it does not replace the need for adequate nitrogen fertilization in enhancing bean productivity.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of the chlorophyll index, which was significantly higher in treatments involving R. tropici and the combination of fungicide and insecticide with either inoculant. This underscores the role of nitrogen in chlorophyll synthesis and overall plant health.\n\nThe findings contribute to understanding the complex interactions between chemical treatments, bacterial inoculation, and nitrogen fertilization in common bean cultivation.

The herbicides tested included diquat (2 L·ha-1), flumioxazin (60 g·ha-1), and a combination of both (di-flu), applied at two phenological stages (80% and 90% pod maturity), alongside a control treatment without herbicide.\n\nResults indicated that herbicide application at both maturity stages did not significantly affect grain yield. Notably, diquat and the di-flu mixture advanced harvest by an average of six days without compromising yield. However, desiccation at the 90% maturity stage positively influenced seed quality, while application at the 80% stage negatively impacted it, leading to increased electrolyte leakage and a higher proportion of abnormal seedlings.\n\nIn the laboratory, seed quality was assessed through various parameters, including germination rates, seed size, and electrical conductivity. The seeds from the 90% maturity stage exhibited larger sizes and better germination rates compared to those from the 80% stage, suggesting that the latter had not reached full physiological maturity. The study also highlighted that the di-flu treatment resulted in superior germination percentages compared to individual herbicides.\n\nStatistical analyses revealed significant correlations between productivity, seed mass, and physiological quality metrics, emphasizing the importance of timing in herbicide application.

Notably, nitrogen-free extract (NFE) digestibility mirrored these findings, with rice, corn, and brown rice showing high values (97.08%, 96.14%, and 95.56%, respectively), while mung beans lagged at 83.38%.\n\nThe study also analyzed amino acid digestibility, revealing no significant differences among rice, corn, brown rice, and barley, except for methionine, which was more efficiently digested in corn and barley. Mung beans, despite being a protein source, exhibited lower overall digestibility, attributed to their higher fiber content and lower starch levels compared to grains.\n\nThe findings suggest that while rice, corn, and brown rice are superior carbohydrate sources for energy and nutrient absorption, mung beans may offer strategic benefits for glycemic control and weight management due to their fiber content. This research provides a foundation for formulating dog diets that meet specific nutritional needs, particularly for weight management and metabolic health.\n\nThe study's implications extend to pet food formulation, indicating that carbohydrate source selection can significantly impact digestibility and overall diet efficacy. The results advocate for the inclusion of high-digestibility grains in dog foods, while also recognizing the potential role of legumes like mung beans in specialized dietary strategies. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term health impacts of these carbohydrate sources in canine diets."}

High copper concentrations in soil pose significant risks to plant health and food safety due to potential bioaccumulation. The research employs a completely randomized design with a 5 × 2 factorial arrangement, testing five biochar doses (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% mm-1 of dry soil) in both copper-treated (1,000 mg kg-1) and untreated soils, with eight replicates.\n\nKey findings indicate that biochar application significantly reduces the availability of copper in contaminated soil, with a linear decrease in copper levels observed in the roots, aerial parts, and grains of P. vulgaris. Specifically, at a biochar dose of 1.66% mm-1, copper concentrations in grains fell below the maximum limit of 10 mg kg-1 set by Brazilian legislation. The study also reports a notable improvement in the total chlorophyll index of plants, attributed to reduced copper uptake, which enhances photosynthetic efficiency.\n\nAnalytical methods employed include atomic absorption spectrophotometry for quantifying copper content in plant tissues and soil, alongside chlorophyll meters for assessing leaf chlorophyll levels. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) were calculated to evaluate copper accumulation and movement within the plant. Results show that biochar application leads to a significant reduction in TF, indicating lower translocation of copper from roots to aerial parts, which is crucial for plant survival in contaminated environments.\n\nThe study highlights the dual role of biochar not only in immobilizing heavy metals but also in supplying essential nutrients, as evidenced by its chemical composition, which includes macronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. This nutrient provision is beneficial for plant growth, particularly in soils impacted by heavy metal contamination.\n\nOverall, the findings underscore the potential of eucalyptus biochar as a sustainable strategy for soil remediation and safe agricultural practices, particularly in regions where copper-based agricultural inputs are prevalent. Future research could explore the long-term effects of biochar on soil health and crop productivity, as well as its interactions with various soil types and other heavy metals."}

The beans analyzed included redbean (Phaseolus vulgaris), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), bambarabean (Vigna subterranea), and mungbean (Phaseolus radiatus), alongside napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and soybean (Glycine max) as a reference.\n\nThe results indicated that all beans contained high crude protein (CP) levels, exceeding 200 g/kg dry matter (DM), with soybean and groundnut showing CP contents above 300 g/kg DM. Redbean exhibited the lowest crude fiber (CF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) levels among the beans, suggesting its potential for higher digestibility. Soybean was characterized by a high proportion of rapidly degraded CP (fraction B1), while redbean and bambarabean had significant amounts of slowly degraded CP (fraction B3). Notably, redbean, pigeonpea, cowpea, and mungbean demonstrated superior dry matter degradability (DMDe) and digestibility (DMDi) compared to soybean, groundnut, and bambarabean.\n\nIn vitro fermentation analysis revealed that redbean produced the highest concentration of total volatile fatty acids (VFAs), a key indicator of fermentation efficiency, while groundnut yielded the lowest. The study employed a two-stage in vitro rumen fermentation technique, maintaining anaerobic conditions and utilizing rumen fluid from fistulated cattle. The fermentation characteristics were assessed through gas chromatography and ammonia concentration measurements, revealing that soybean generated the highest ammonia levels, indicative of its rapid protein degradation.\n\nThe study also explored the correlation between chemical composition and fermentation parameters, finding that CP was positively correlated with CP degradability and ammonia concentration, while fiber components negatively impacted DMDe and DMDi. The findings suggest that while soybean remains a high-quality protein source, alternative beans like redbean, pigeonpea, cowpea, and mungbean possess significant potential as substitutes due to their favorable nutrient profiles and fermentation characteristics.\n\nIn conclusion, the research identifies groundnut, redbean, pigeonpea, cowpea, and mungbean as viable alternatives to soybean for ruminant feeding, particularly highlighting redbean's low fiber content and high protein bypass potential. This study contributes to the search for sustainable protein sources in animal nutrition, addressing the increasing demand for soybean and the challenges associated with its production.

Sixteen intact male sheep were subjected to a completely randomized design with four treatments: 0%, 11%, 22%, and 33% common-bean residue on a dry matter (DM) basis, replacing cottonseed cake. The study aimed to optimize the use of agro-industrial by-products in ruminant nutrition, given the high protein content of common-bean residue and its potential to reduce feed costs.\n\nResults indicated that increasing levels of common-bean residue led to a linear decrease in the intake of dry matter (DMI), crude protein (CPI), organic matter (OMI), ether extract (EEI), and indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDFI), with significant reductions observed at P<0.05. Specifically, every 1% increase in common-bean residue resulted in a decrease of 4.93 g DMI per animal per day. However, the intake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC), and total digestible nutrients (TDN) remained unchanged across treatments.\n\nConversely, the digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, organic matter, and neutral detergent fiber increased linearly with the inclusion of common-bean residue, suggesting that higher fiber content may enhance nutrient retention time in the rumen, thereby improving digestibility. The digestibility coefficients for DM, CP, and organic matter increased by 0.22, 0.19, and 0.21 percentage units, respectively, for each 1% of common-bean residue added.\n\nWater intake also increased with higher levels of common-bean residue, attributed to the increased dietary fiber content, which necessitates greater hydration for digestion. The study concluded that incorporating up to 22% common-bean residue in sheep diets can achieve a favorable balance between nutrient intake and digestibility, making it a viable alternative feed source.\n\nThis research highlights the potential of common-bean residue as a sustainable feed option in sheep nutrition, contributing to reduced feed costs and environmental waste management. Further studies are warranted to explore the long-term effects of such dietary inclusions on animal health and productivity."}

The research aims to elucidate how drying temperature and storage duration affect the quality parameters critical for consumer acceptability and food industry applications.\n\nKey findings indicate that prolonged storage significantly reduces protein solubility, crude protein content, tannins, and lipids, while increasing cooking time, fat acidity, and enzymatic activities of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. Specifically, cooking time escalated from 21 minutes at the start of storage to 39 minutes after 225 days, particularly pronounced in beans dried at 60 °C. This increase in cooking time correlates with structural changes in the cell walls of the cotyledons, likely due to cross-linking of polysaccharides and phenolic compounds during storage.\n\nThe study also highlights that the drying temperature primarily influences the physical integrity of the beans, with higher temperatures leading to increased broken grain percentages and roughness. Notably, the integrity of the beans remained stable during storage, suggesting that drying conditions are more critical than storage conditions for maintaining grain quality.\n\nMoisture content increased from 11.5% to approximately 14% over the storage period, attributed to hygroscopic equilibrium with the storage environment. The enzymatic activities of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase increased during storage, with higher initial activities observed in beans dried at elevated temperatures, suggesting that drying conditions can enhance enzymatic stability and activity.\n\nTannin levels remained stable for the first 75 days but decreased significantly thereafter, indicating potential degradation or migration of these compounds during storage. The study underscores the importance of monitoring these parameters, as they directly impact the nutritional quality and consumer acceptability of beans.\n\nAnalytical methods employed included moisture content determination via oven drying, protein content analysis using AOAC methods, and enzymatic activity assays for peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. The findings contribute valuable insights into the postharvest handling of black beans, emphasizing the need for optimized drying and storage practices to preserve their quality for both direct consumption and industrial processing.\n\nIn conclusion, the research provides critical data on the effects of drying temperature and storage duration on the quality of black beans, highlighting the implications for food science and plant breeding strategies aimed at improving bean resilience and nutritional value."}

Conversely, in the dry season, ‘IAC Carioca Tybatã’ demonstrated higher seedling emergence. Overall, seeds cultivated in the dry season showed enhanced germination and vigor relative to those grown in the rainy season. The accelerated aging test indicated that phosphorus application significantly improved seed vigor, particularly at higher doses during the dry season.\n\nAnalytical methods included standard seed quality assessments such as water content, germination tests, first germination count, accelerated aging, electrical conductivity, and field seedling emergence. Results indicated that the cultivar ‘IAC Carioca Precoce’ had lower water content than ‘IAC Carioca Tybatã’ in the dry season, while both cultivars maintained germination rates exceeding the 80% threshold necessary for commercial viability. The first germination count revealed that seeds from the dry season had greater vigor, with optimal phosphorus doses identified at 30 and 60 kg ha^-1 for both cultivars.\n\nThe study underscores the critical role of phosphorus in enhancing seed quality, with findings suggesting that optimal fertilization can lead to improved seed vigor and emergence. The interaction between cultivar and growing season was significant, indicating that genetic variability influences seed quality responses to environmental conditions.

Conducted in a greenhouse setting, the experiment utilized a completely randomized design with five treatments involving different quantities of earthworms (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 worms per pot) across eight replicates. The results demonstrated that earthworm presence significantly enhanced plant growth metrics, including plant height and dry matter production, while also improving soil biological properties such as microbial biomass and respiration.\n\nKey findings include a linear increase in soil respiration correlating with the number of earthworms, with treatments showing 2.5% to 14% higher CO2 emissions compared to controls. Microbial biomass carbon increased from 10.19% to 15.42% with earthworm treatments, peaking at approximately five earthworms per pot before declining at higher densities. This suggests that while earthworms enhance microbial activity and nutrient cycling, excessive densities may lead to competition for resources, limiting microbial growth.\n\nThe study also noted significant correlations between earthworm biomass and various plant and soil attributes, indicating that earthworm inoculation can be a beneficial agricultural practice for enhancing common bean production. The positive effects on plant growth were attributed to improved soil structure and nutrient availability, as earthworm coprolites are richer in nutrients than surrounding soil. Additionally, the study highlighted that the increased soil CO2 emissions from earthworm activity could be mitigated by incorporating common bean crop residues back into the soil.\n\nOverall, this research underscores the importance of earthworms in promoting sustainable agricultural practices, particularly in legume cultivation, by enhancing soil health and plant productivity.

Conducted over two growing seasons, the research employed a split-plot design with four inoculation treatments: control (non-inoculated), inoculation with *R. tropici*, inoculation with *A. brasilense*, and co-inoculation of both. Additionally, five nitrogen (N) topdressing rates (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 kg N ha⁻¹) were tested.\n\nResults indicated that inoculation with *R. tropici*, either alone or in combination with *A. brasilense*, significantly enhanced root nodulation and grain yield, particularly during the dry season. Co-inoculation led to a 43% increase in nodule number compared to *R. tropici* alone in the spring-summer season. However, *A. brasilense* alone did not improve yield, performing similarly to non-inoculated plants across both seasons. The study found that higher N application rates negatively impacted nodule formation, with optimal N rates for topdressing identified between 80 and 90 kg N ha⁻¹.\n\nNodulation metrics, including nodule number and dry weight, were significantly affected by inoculation treatments, with *R. tropici* alone or in combination with *A. brasilense* yielding the highest values. Conversely, increasing N rates correlated with reduced nodulation, supporting the hypothesis that excess nitrogen inhibits the symbiotic relationship essential for biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). This aligns with previous findings that high N levels can suppress flavonoid production, which is crucial for nodule formation.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of environmental conditions, noting that the positive effects of inoculation were more pronounced during the drier growing season, suggesting that co-inoculation may enhance drought tolerance through improved root architecture and nutrient uptake. Grain yield improvements were significant in the summer-fall season, with *R. tropici* alone increasing yield by 19.9% and co-inoculation by 26.6% compared to non-inoculated controls.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings underscore the potential of using *R. tropici* and *A. brasilense* in tandem to optimize BNF and enhance common bean productivity, particularly under drought conditions.

Conducted over two years (2014 and 2016) in Selvíria, MS, Brazil, the research employed a randomized block design with a 5 × 4 factorial arrangement, comprising five maize residue treatments (exclusive maize, maize + Crotalaria spectabilis, maize + Cajanus cajan, maize + Canavalia ensiformis, and maize + Urochloa ruziziensis) and four nitrogen (N) rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha^-1).\n\nKey findings indicate that intercropping with cover crops significantly increased the dry matter of plant residues on the soil surface compared to exclusive maize cultivation, with the highest yields observed from maize + Cajanus cajan and maize + Urochloa ruziziensis. However, these treatments did not enhance the productivity of the subsequent bean crop, as no significant differences were found in yield components such as the number of pods per plant, grains per plant, grains per pod, or 100-grain weight across treatments.\n\nNitrogen fertilization positively influenced the dry matter production of bean plants, which exhibited a linear increase with rising N rates, achieving maximum values of 6.79 g plant^-1 in 2014 and 8.44 g plant^-1 in 2016 at the highest N application. Despite this, only the first year of cultivation showed a significant response in grain yield to N application, with yields increasing linearly up to 120 kg ha^-1. In contrast, the second year did not demonstrate a yield response to N, suggesting that residual nutrients from previous crops and biological nitrogen fixation (via inoculation with Rhizobium tropici and Azospirillum brasilense) were sufficient to meet the bean crop's nitrogen demands.\n\nThe study concludes that while intercropping maize with cover crops enhances soil cover and dry matter production, it does not significantly affect bean yield in successive cropping systems. The findings underscore the importance of nitrogen management in optimizing bean productivity, particularly in no-tillage systems where the timing and type of previous crop residues can influence nutrient availability. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term impacts of cover crop combinations and their interactions with nitrogen fertilization on bean yield and soil health."}

The research aimed to optimize the symbiotic performance of these microorganisms under greenhouse conditions, hypothesizing that co-inoculation would enhance nodulation, plant growth, and productivity compared to single inoculations or controls.\n\nThe experimental design included nine treatments: a control without nitrogen (N) and inoculation, N addition (100 kg N ha^-1), and various combinations of the three microbial inoculants. The results demonstrated that co-inoculation with R. tropici, R. freirei, A. brasilense, and A. cylindrica significantly improved plant height, root length, root volume, shoot dry matter, and nitrogen accumulation. Notably, the treatment with all three inoculants (Riz+Azo+Ana) resulted in an 84% increase in grain yield compared to the control, comparable to the N addition treatment.\n\nThe study highlighted that treatments involving Rhizobium consistently enhanced nodulation, with the highest nodule counts and dry weights observed in co-inoculated plants. The presence of A. cylindrica was particularly beneficial, contributing to increased iron solubility and promoting plant growth through the production of phytohormones. The authors noted that co-inoculation strategies could replace mineral nitrogen fertilizers, thus promoting sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nAnalytical methods included a completely randomized experimental design with four replications, and statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA and PCA to assess the relationships between treatments and growth parameters. The PCA revealed that treatments with microbial inoculation clustered together, indicating their positive effects on plant growth metrics compared to the control.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of using A. cylindrica as a biofertilizer in conjunction with rhizobia and azospirilla to enhance common bean production.

Seven cultivars were analyzed under both control and salt stress conditions (50 mmol L^-1 NaCl), assessing physiological quality through germination rates, vigor indices, and seedling lengths.\n\nKey findings indicate that salt stress adversely affects the mobilization of seed reserves, leading to decreased alpha-amylase activity and reduced seedling performance. High-vigor seed lots exhibited superior physiological performance under stress, characterized by better germination percentages and seedling growth compared to lower vigor cultivars. Specifically, cultivars BAF55, BAF42, and BAF81 demonstrated the highest vigor indices and seedling lengths, while BAF07 and BAF23 were classified as low vigor.\n\nAlpha-amylase, the primary enzyme responsible for starch hydrolysis, showed significant activity in high-vigor seeds under control conditions, correlating positively with vigor. However, under salt stress, this correlation diminished, suggesting that other mechanisms may influence starch mobilization and seedling establishment during stress. The study highlights that while alpha-amylase activity is crucial for reserve mobilization in optimal conditions, its role may be less significant under stress, where hormonal changes could inhibit enzyme function.\n\nAnalytical methods included measuring seed reserve reduction, starch content, and enzyme activity using spectrophotometric assays. The results revealed that salt stress led to a significant decrease in starch hydrolysis and reserve mobilization rates, with high-vigor cultivars utilizing reserves more efficiently than low-vigor ones.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) further elucidated the relationship between alpha-amylase activity and seed vigor, indicating that high-vigor seeds not only mobilize reserves more effectively but also maintain higher enzyme activity in non-stress conditions.

Conversely, N-fertilizer application reduced both NN and NDM, corroborating previous studies that suggest plants preferentially utilize available N from fertilizers over BNF, thereby diminishing nodulation and BNF activity.\n\nGrowth parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), root dry mass (RDM), and shoot dry mass (SDM) were positively influenced by N-fertilizer, particularly in the 2016-2017 season, where N-fertilized treatments yielded higher grain yields (GY). However, in the subsequent season, the GY of the inoculated treatment was statistically comparable to several N-fertilized treatments, suggesting that under certain conditions, BNF can effectively substitute for synthetic N.\n\nEconomic analysis revealed that while N-fertilizer treatments incurred higher production costs (PC), the inoculated treatment (P0V40R50) consistently demonstrated lower costs, approximately 8% less than N-fertilized treatments across both seasons. Gross revenue (GR), net revenue (NR), and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) were influenced by grain prices, which were significantly higher in the first season compared to the second. In the 2017-2018 season, the inoculated treatment achieved GR, NR, and BCR values comparable to those of N-fertilized treatments, emphasizing the economic viability of BNF in common bean production.\n\nIn conclusion, the study underscores the potential of BNF as a sustainable practice in common bean cultivation, highlighting its ability to maintain economic competitiveness with N-fertilization while reducing environmental impacts associated with synthetic fertilizers.

The extraction process utilizes 80% ethanol, followed by drying and trimethylsilylation (TMS) of the sugars, which are then analyzed using gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). The precision of the method was evaluated, revealing coefficients of variation of 4.1% for sugar contents below 1% and 3.8% for contents above 1%. Recovery rates for added raffinose ranged from 89.3% to 102.0%, indicating the method's reliability.\n\nThe authors highlight the inadequacies of existing carbohydrate quantification methods in food composition tables, which often include non-digestible sugars like hemicellulose, thus failing to accurately represent the energy-providing carbohydrates in legumes. This study aims to establish a clear and effective method for the quantification of oligosaccharides, which are present at several percent levels in legumes.\n\nPrevious methods for oligosaccharide quantification, including colorimetric assays following various chromatographic separations (e.g., activated carbon column chromatography, paper chromatography, thin-layer chromatography), were noted for their lengthy procedures and complexity, which could compromise accuracy. In contrast, GLC and liquid chromatography (LC) offer faster and simpler alternatives. However, the extraction methods previously reported for GLC were not universally applicable to all samples, particularly defatted soybean flour.\n\nThe study outlines the preparation of TMS derivatives and the GLC conditions used. The method demonstrated complete separation and quantification of the target oligosaccharides. The authors also optimized the sample preparation techniques, including the use of n-hexane extraction for fatty samples and two distinct extraction methods with 80% ethanol, both of which proved effective for oligosaccharide quantification.\n\nQuantitative results from 15 commercial bean samples indicated that the oligosaccharide content was consistent with previously reported values, affirming the method's validity. The study emphasizes the importance of precise quantification of oligosaccharides in legumes, which have implications for nutritional assessment and food science.\n\nIn conclusion, the developed GLC method for quantifying oligosaccharides in beans and their products is robust, with high precision and recovery rates, making it a valuable tool for future food composition analyses.

Notably, the study found no clear distinction in nutrient profiles between the Mesoamerican and Andean landraces, contradicting previous findings that suggested superior mineral content in Mesoamerican genotypes.\n\nStatistical analyses indicated significant differences in N, P, K, Fe, Zn, and Mn content among the morphotypes, with the dwarf landrace 'Biser' from the Mesoamerican gene pool exhibiting the highest levels of P, Ca, Mg, Mn, and Zn. Conversely, the climbing landrace 'Visoki Trešnjevac' from the Andean gene pool had the highest nitrogen content, while 'Puter' showed the highest potassium levels.\n\nThe phaseolin type analysis indicated that 75 accessions predominantly belonged to the Mesoamerican gene pool (phaseolin type I), while the remaining accessions were classified under the Andean gene pool (types II and III). This classification aligns with previous research indicating a higher prevalence of Andean accessions in European common bean populations.\n\nThe findings underscore the potential of Croatian common bean landraces as valuable genetic resources for breeding programs aimed at improving nutritional content and resilience to environmental stresses. The study provides a foundational dataset for future research on the genetic and biochemical traits of common beans, emphasizing the importance of landrace diversity in enhancing food security and nutrition."}
{"doi": "10.5513_JCEA01_23.1.3200", "summary": "This study investigates the symbiotic efficiency of indigenous rhizobial strains isolated from Northwestern Croatia in relation to two common bean cultivars, Trešnjevac and Slavonski zeleni. A two-factorial greenhouse experiment was conducted, involving 12 indigenous Rhizobium spp. strains and the two bean cultivars, to assess nodulation ability, compatibility, and nitrogen fixation efficiency.\n\nKey findings indicate significant variability in symbiotic efficiency among the rhizobial strains. The strain HO12 exhibited the highest dry nodule biomass, while strains MB1 and DE7 resulted in the greatest shoot dry weight. Notably, strain DE7 also yielded the highest nitrogen content in the dry shoot, highlighting its potential for enhancing nitrogen availability in common bean cultivation. The Trešnjevac cultivar consistently outperformed Slavonski zeleni across all measured parameters, suggesting inherent genetic advantages in nodulation and nitrogen fixation.\n\nStatistical analyses revealed significant differences in dry nodule biomass, shoot dry weight, and nitrogen content based on the rhizobial strain and bean cultivar. The interaction between strain and cultivar was significant only for nitrogen content, indicating that the effectiveness of specific strains may vary depending on the host plant. The indigenous strains demonstrated comparable nodulation abilities to the reference strain R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli, with most indigenous strains showing high compatibility and symbiotic efficiency.\n\nThe results underscore the potential of indigenous rhizobial strains for pre-sowing inoculation in common bean production, particularly in the context of sustainable agriculture. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting effective rhizobial strains to optimize nitrogen fixation, thereby reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers and enhancing crop yields. Future field trials are recommended to validate these findings and further explore the application of these indigenous strains in commercial bean production systems.\n\nIn summary, the research provides valuable insights into the symbiotic relationships between common beans and indigenous rhizobia, identifying promising strains for agricultural practices that could improve nitrogen fixation and overall crop performance in Northwestern Croatia."}
{"doi": "10.5513_JCEA01_25.2.4062", "summary": "This study investigates the intercropping of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) with climbing bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to enhance forage yield and quality, addressing the challenges of low protein content in sole sorghum crops. Conducted over two growing seasons (2018 and 2019) in Oborovo, Croatia, the research evaluates various sowing densities of climbing bean alongside a constant density of sweet sorghum (18.0 seeds/m²). The treatments included combinations of sweet sorghum with climbing bean at densities of 3.7, 5.0, and 7.5 seeds/m².\n\nResults indicate that the highest dry matter yield (20.7 t/ha) was achieved with the treatment of 18.0 plants/m² of sweet sorghum and 7.5 plants/m² of climbing bean, outperforming the sole sweet sorghum yield of 18.2 t/ha. Additionally, intercropping significantly reduced the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content, enhancing forage digestibility. The climbing bean's contribution to increased crude protein content was notable, with the highest protein yield (2.41 t/ha) recorded in the 7.5 seeds/m² treatment.\n\nThe study highlights the ecological benefits of intercropping, such as improved soil nutrient utilization and microbial activity, attributed to the complementary rooting systems of the two species. The climbing bean's ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen further enhances the nutritional profile of the forage, making it a viable strategy for improving livestock nutrition and reducing feed costs.\n\nStatistical analyses confirmed significant differences in yield and quality parameters across treatments (P < 0.05), with the intercropped systems demonstrating superior performance in terms of crude protein, ash, and calcium content compared to sole sorghum. The findings underscore the potential of sweet sorghum and climbing bean intercropping as a sustainable agricultural practice that can optimize forage production while addressing protein deficiencies in livestock diets.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal intercropping treatment of sweet sorghum with climbing bean at a density of 18.0 and 7.5 plants/m², respectively, not only maximizes dry matter and protein yields but also improves the overall quality of the forage, presenting a promising approach for enhancing ruminant nutrition and promoting sustainable agricultural practices."}
{"doi": "10.55730_1300-011X.3215", "summary": "This research article investigates the bioactive content and aroma compounds of three geographically indicated dry bean varieties from Turkey: İspir, Narman, and Hınıs. The study highlights significant differences in total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, sugar composition, and volatile compounds among these beans, which are crucial for their nutritional and sensory qualities.\n\nThe total phenolic content varied significantly, with Hınıs beans exhibiting the highest concentration at 36.73 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 100 g, followed by İspir (24.78 mg GAE) and Narman (14.09 mg GAE). The antioxidant activity, measured using the DPPH method, was highest in İspir beans (8.38% inhibition) and lowest in Narman beans (6.02%). Sugar analysis revealed that Hınıs beans had the highest total sugar content (6.46%), while Narman and İspir beans contained 5.60% and 4.22%, respectively. Notably, Hınıs beans also had the highest sucrose content (5.30%).\n\nAroma profiling through headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) identified 40 volatile compounds, including 10 alcohols, 5 terpenes, 11 aldehydes, 4 esters, 6 acids, and 4 ketones. Aldehydes, particularly hexanal, were the most abundant volatiles across all samples. Narman beans had higher levels of total alcohols, acids, and esters compared to İspir and Hınıs, while İspir beans contained more terpenes and ketones.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were employed to assess the differences in bioactive and volatile profiles among the bean varieties. The analyses revealed that Narman beans clustered separately from İspir and Hınıs beans, indicating distinct flavor and nutritional characteristics.\n\nThis study underscores the importance of these local bean varieties in Turkish cuisine and their potential health benefits due to their rich bioactive compounds. The findings contribute to the understanding of the nutritional value and sensory attributes of these beans, which can inform breeding programs and marketing strategies aimed at preserving local genetic resources. The research highlights the need for further exploration of the genetic and environmental factors influencing the phenolic and volatile profiles of these beans, as well as their implications for consumer preferences and health."}
{"doi": "10.5586_aa.2013.015", "summary": "In this study, Głowacka (2013) investigates the impact of strip cropping on weed infestation in dent maize (Zea mays L.), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) over three growing seasons (2008-2010) at the Experimental Station of the University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Poland. The research evaluates two primary factors: cropping method (sole vs. strip cropping) and weed control methods (mechanical vs. chemical).\n\nThe experimental design involved growing the crops in adjacent strips of 3.3 m width, allowing for independent mechanical cultivation while promoting ecological interactions. The study assessed weed infestation by analyzing species composition, density, and dry weight of weeds two weeks prior to harvest. Dominant weed species across all crops included Echinochloa crus-galli, Chenopodium album, and Galinsoga parviflora, which constituted 58% to 70% of the total weed population.\n\nResults indicated that strip cropping significantly reduced both the number of weeds per unit area and their dry weight in dent maize and common bean crops compared to sole cropping. Specifically, strip cropping decreased weed density by 27% in maize and 26% in common bean, with corresponding reductions in dry weight of 41% and 33%, respectively. In spring barley, the effect of strip cropping was less pronounced, significantly reducing weed density but not biomass.\n\nThe effectiveness of weed control methods varied, with chemical control significantly reducing weed density and biomass compared to mechanical methods. For instance, chemical control decreased weed density by an average of 64.4% and biomass by 46.7% compared to mechanical methods. Notably, the combination of strip cropping and mechanical weed control yielded the most substantial reductions in weed infestation, suggesting that this approach could enhance sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of crop diversity and intercropping systems in managing weed populations, thereby potentially reducing herbicide reliance. The findings underscore the ecological benefits of strip cropping, including improved soil health and reduced competition from weeds, which can contribute to more sustainable agricultural systems. Future research may explore the long-term effects of strip cropping on weed dynamics and crop yield stability under varying environmental conditions."}
{"doi": "10.7717_peerj.11463", "summary": "In the study conducted by Mohamed et al. (2021), the effects of phosphorus (P) fertilization sources and rates on the growth and ion accumulation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) under salinity stress were investigated. The research was motivated by the increasing salinity in agricultural soils, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, which adversely affects legume crops known for their salt sensitivity.\n\nThe experimental design utilized a split-plot arrangement with two P sources—single superphosphate (SP) and urea phosphate (UP)—and four P application rates (0.0, 17.5, 35.0, and 52.5 kg P ha–1). Key findings indicated that all P treatments significantly enhanced growth parameters, including plant height, leaf area, and total dry weight (TDW). Notably, the application of 35 kg P ha–1 was identified as optimal, yielding the highest TDW of 1.675 t ha–1 for SP and 1.875 t ha–1 for UP.\n\nThe study also assessed the accumulation of essential macronutrients (N, P, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) and micronutrients (Fe3+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu2+) in both shoots and roots. Results showed that UP significantly increased the concentrations of these nutrients compared to SP, particularly at the 35 kg P ha–1 rate. Furthermore, the highest P application rate (52.5 kg ha–1) effectively reduced Na+ concentrations in both plant tissues, suggesting a potential mechanism for alleviating salinity stress.\n\nPhotosynthetic pigments, specifically total chlorophylls and carotenoids, were also positively influenced by P application, with UP enhancing these compounds more than SP. The nucleic acid content (DNA and RNA) was significantly elevated with P application, correlating with improved growth metrics. The study established a strong positive correlation between nucleic acid content and TDW, emphasizing the role of P in promoting cellular processes under stress conditions.\n\nStatistical analyses revealed that the quadratic model better described the relationship between P rates and TDW than the linear model, indicating a complex interaction between P availability and plant response to salinity. The findings suggest that P fertilization, particularly in the form of urea phosphate, can enhance the growth and nutritional quality of common bean under saline conditions, providing valuable insights for agronomic practices aimed at improving crop resilience in salinized soils.\n\nIn conclusion, the research underscores the critical role of phosphorus in mitigating salinity stress in common beans, with implications for breeding strategies and nutrient management in saline-affected agricultural systems."}
{"doi": "10.9755_ejfa.2018.v30.i12.1884", "summary": "In the study conducted by Delfini et al. (2018), the genetic parameters and genotypic values of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars were estimated using mixed models, specifically REML/BLUP (Restricted Maximum Likelihood/Best Linear Unbiased Prediction). The research aimed to assess the variability among 20 carioca and 19 black bean cultivars, focusing on 23 agromorphological traits, including grain yield (YLD), pod length (PL), and seed weight (W1000).\n\nThe analysis revealed significant genetic variability among the cultivars, with broad-sense heritability (h²) values ranging from 0.05 to 0.72 across traits. Notably, YLD exhibited low heritability (0.12) in both groups, indicating a strong influence of genotype-environment (GE) interaction. The carioca group showed higher heritability for morphological traits, while the black group excelled in pod and seed traits. Selective accuracy (Ac) was high for most traits, suggesting reliable predictions of genetic values.\n\nThe study utilized a randomized complete block design across four environments in Paraná, Brazil, allowing for robust statistical analysis of the data. Deviance analysis confirmed significant differences among genotypes for all traits evaluated, with moderate correlations observed for YLD with seed morphology in the black group and seed quantity in the carioca group. Ward's hierarchical clustering identified three distinct clusters for carioca cultivars and four for black cultivars, reflecting genetic diversity.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of genetic variability in breeding programs, particularly in the context of developing cultivars with high yield potential and adaptability to varying environmental conditions. The predicted genotypic values highlighted several cultivars with superior performance, such as IPR Bem-te-vi and IPR Nhambu, which demonstrated high adaptability and stability across environments.\n\nThis research contributes valuable insights into the genetic basis of common bean cultivars, emphasizing the need for continued exploration of genetic diversity to enhance breeding strategies. The results also indicate that while advancements have been made in breeding for yield, the influence of environmental factors remains a critical challenge, necessitating further investigation into the genetic mechanisms underlying these traits."}
